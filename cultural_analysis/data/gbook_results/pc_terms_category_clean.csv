9,Intersectionality,"Concepts, Perspectives and Challenges",Thomas Moeller,"Intersectionality: Concepts, Perspectives and Challenges first presents a study wherein two students, one male and one female, were interviewed about their transition from a historically black college and university undergraduate program to a predominantly white institution for their graduate studies in biochemistry. The students had similar undergraduate experiences and both shared feelings of isolation, the drawbacks of academic rigor in graduate STEM programs, and the need to represent both themselves and their race. Next, the authors explore narrative responses of bisexual Latinx women and, through an intersectionality lens, adapted the minority stress model to include their experiences. This study further supports the need for intersectional minority stress research and a necessary focus on sexually marginalized bisexual Latinx women. The closing chapter summarizes the way in which intersectionality has been at the center of both feminist debates and the theory of gender. In the United States, Canada and Europe, it has achieved a hegemonic status strengthened by its multiple possible applications.",1536171107,"Intersectionality Concepts, Perspectives and Challenges"

This book takes up a range of cases -- including those of Antigone, Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks, the 1992 Los Angeles riots, and the Black Lives Matter movement -- to better understand who counts as a political actor, and how we understand political belonging and the contestation of exclusion.

53,"Misogyny, Toxic Masculinity, and Heteronormativity in Post-2000 Popular Music",,Glenn Fosbraey,"This book presents chapters that have been brought together to consider the multitude of ways that post-2000 popular music impacts on our cultures and experiences. The focus is on misogyny, toxic masculinity, and heteronormativity. The authors of the chapters consider these three concepts in a wide range of popular music styles and genres; they analyse and evaluate how the concepts are maintained and normalized, challenged, and rejected. The interconnected nature of these concepts is also woven throughout the book. The book also seeks to expand the idea of popular music as understood by many in the West to include popular music genres from outside western Europe and North America that are often ignored (for example, Bollywood and Italian hip hop), and to bring in music genres that are inarguably popular, but also sit under other labels such as rap, metal, and punk.",9783030651893,
55,Young Men Navigating Contemporary Masculinities,,Karla Elliott,"This book explores navigations of contemporary masculinities amongst young, advantaged men living in Australia and Germany. Taking an intersectional approach, the book argues that more open, egalitarian forms of masculinity, such as caring masculinities, are fostered by marginalised groups. Elliott investigates ways in which privileged men can move towards this openness alongside ongoing expressions of more traditional or regressive masculinity. Drawing on interviews, the book explores these navigations and the ways in which they are bound up with themes such as work, mobility, relationships, the privileges and pressures of masculinities, and the contradictions and difficulties of masculinities under neoliberalism. What is revealed is the need for change at individual, collective and structural levels, with care and openness amongst men as a means of achieving this change. Young Men Navigating Contemporary Masculinities will be of interest to students and scholars in fields such as sociology, gender studies, critical studies on men and masculinities, and cultural studies.",9783030363956,
57,Women Writing Fancy,Authorship and Autonomy from 1611 to 1812,Maura Smyth,"This book brings to the foreground the largely forgotten “Fancy” of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and follows its traces as they extend into the nineteenth and twentieth. Trivialized for its flightiness and femininity, Fancy nonetheless provided seventeenth- and eighteenth-century women writers such as Margaret Cavendish, Aphra Behn, Delarivier Manley, Eliza Haywood, and Anna Barbauld a mode of vision that could detect flaws in the Enlightenment’s patriarchal systems and glimpse new, female-authored worlds and genres. In carving out unreal, fanciful spaces within the larger frame of patriarchal culture, these women writers planted Fancy—and, with it, female authorial invention—at the cornerstone of Enlightenment empirical endeavor. By finally taking Fancy seriously, this book offers an alternate genealogy of female authorship and a new framework for understanding modernity’s triumph.",9783319494272,Women Writing Fancy Authorship and Autonomy from 1611 to 1812
59,"The Oxford Handbook of Theology, Sexuality, and Gender",,Adrian Thatcher,"The Oxford Handbook of Theology, Sexuality, and Gender presents an unrivalled overview of the theological study of sexuality and gender. These topics are not merely contentious and pervasive: they have escalated in importance within theology. Theologians increasingly agree that even the very doctrine of God cannot be contemplated without a prior grappling with each. Featuring 41 newly-commissioned essays, written by some of the foremost scholars in the discipline, this authoritative collection presents and develops the latest thinking in these areas. Divided into eight thematic sections, the Handbook explores: methodological approaches; contributions from neighbouring disciplines; sexuality and gender in the Bible, and in the Christian tradition; controversies within the churches, and within four of the non-Christian faiths; and key concepts and issues. The final, extended section considers theology in relation to married people and families; gay and lesbian people; bisexual people; intersex and transgender people; disabled people; and to friends. This volume is an essential reference for students and scholars, which will also stimulate further research.",9780199664153,
61,Women and Kinship,Comparative Perspectives on Gender in South and South-East Asia,Leela Dube,"This is the first sustained effort to compare South and South-East Asia in respect of the situation of women. Arguing that kinship systems provide an important context in which gender relations are located, the study overlooks at three types of kinship system, found in their carious forms in the two regions of Asia--predominantly patrilineal South Asia and predominantly bilateral South-East Asia, with a presence of matriliny in both. The treatment of kinship departs significantly from what is usually found. Gender permeates the examination of the chosen themes, which include group placement and perpetuation, entitlement to and rights over resources, marriage, conjugal relations, implications of residence, rights over space and children, family structures and kin networks, work, female sexuality, and limits set by bodily processes. The underlying assumptions is that kinship systems are neither innocuous nor immutable, and, operating through material relations, they express themselves most effective through values and ideology. For comparison are taken up selected populations of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand--representing Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity. The results are striking: South-East Asian women's unusual degree of autonomy in economic and social life and the relative egalitarianism between the sexes contrast sharply with the situation in South Asia, characterized by strong patriliny, patrilocal family structure, women's lack of rights, and concern about female sexuality. Many other contrasts in respect of gender parities and disparities, including education, nutrition, health, and work emanate from contrasting features of kinship. Rich in information ad insights, the book fills a gap in gender studies at the same time as it challenges facile generalizations and provokes probing into apparently similar phenomena.",UOM:39015039887446,Women and Kinship Comparative Perspectives on Gender in South and South-East Asia

Drawing on a rich collection of theoretically-informed case studies, its authors provide practical advice and examples on implementing gender-inclusive approaches and language strategies in the classroom. It focuses on topics including, how to develop gender-inclusive practices to challenge students’ attitudes and behaviours; whether there are institutional constraints that prevent trainers from implementing non-heteronormative practices in their teaching; and how gender awareness can become an everyday mode of expression. Positioned at the lively interface of gender and translation studies, this work will be of interest to practitioners and scholars from across the fields of linguistics, education, sociology and cultural studies.",9783030043902,Gender Approaches in the Translation Classroom Training the Doers
69,Gender Equality in Changing Times,Multidisciplinary Reflections on Struggles and Progress,Angela Smith,"This edited collection explores issues of gender equality in the global context. Campaigns to achieve gender equality throughout the twentieth century brought about huge changes in westernised countries. In particular, the achievements of second-wave feminism with regards to gender and sexual equality benefit many people today. The famous 'seven demands' of the second-wave movement form the basis of the chapters of this book, probing the advances made legally, socially and culturally. Contributors to this collection acknowledge the advances brought about by the second-wave movement, but highlight the work which still needs to be done in the twenty-first century, including the changes in society that have resulted in shifts in masculinity. Gender Equality in Changing Times is divided into two parts, following an overview of theoretical debates and social contexts that lead us to the current period of gender and sexual relations. Part One looks at gender equality by exploring the 'experience' of being part of a group where gender boundaries still exist, drawing on auto-ethnographies of those in key groups that are central to this debate, as well as interviews with members of such groups. Part Two investigates wider representations of these groups, offering an insight into the geopolitical world of gender relations in Saudi Arabia and China. Ultimately, this collection shows how much has been achieved, yet how far is also left to go. Students and scholars across a range of disciplines, including gender studies, history, education, sociology, media studies, politics, business studies, cultural studies and English literature and linguistics, will find this book of interest.",9783030265700,Gender Equality in Changing Times Multidisciplinary Reflections on Struggles and Progress

74,Feminist Activism and Digital Networks,Between Empowerment and Vulnerability,Aristea Fotopoulou,"This book sheds new light on the way that, in the last decade, digital technologies have become inextricably linked to culture, economy and politics and how they have transformed feminist and queer activism. This exciting text critically analyses the contradictions, tensions and often-paradoxical aspects that characterize such politics, both in relation to identity and to activist practice. Aristea Fotopoulou examines how activists make claims about rights online, and how they negotiate access, connectivity, openness and visibility in digital networks. Through a triple focus on embodied media practices, labour and imaginaries, and across the themes of bodily autonomy, pornography, reproduction, and queer social life, she advocates a move away from understandings of digital media technologies as intrinsically exploitative or empowering. By reinstating the media as constant material agents in the process of politicization, Fotopoulou creates a powerful text that appeals to students and scholars of digital media, gender and sexuality, and readers interested in the role of media technologies in activism.",9781137504715,Feminist Activism and Digital Networks Between Empowerment and Vulnerability
76,"Girls, Autobiography, Media",Gender and Self-Mediation in Digital Economies,Emma Maguire,"This book investigates how girls’ automedial selves are constituted and consumed as literary or media products in a digital landscape dominated by intimate, though quite public, modes of self-disclosure and pervaded by broader practices of self-branding. In thinking about how girlhood as a potentially vulnerable subject position circulates as a commodity, Girls, Autobiography, Media argues that by using digital technologies to write themselves into culture, girls and young women are staking a claim on public space and asserting the right to create and distribute their own representations of girlhood. Their texts—in the form of blogs, vlogs, photo-sharing platforms, online diaries and fangirl identities—show how they navigate the sometimes hostile conditions of online spaces in order to become narrators of their own lives and stories. By examining case studies across different digital forms of self-presentation by girls and young women, this book considers how mediation and autobiographical practices are deeply interlinked, and it highlights the significant contribution girls and young women have made to contemporary digital forms of life narrative.",9783319742373,"Girls, Autobiography, Media Gender and Self-Mediation in Digital Economies"

94,Spirituality in Diversity,South East Asia Meets South Africa : Towards a Global View of Spiritual Counselling,Ulrike Elsdörfer,"The purpose of this book is to introduce the special phenomenon of Spiritual Counselling, as it is practised by Christians in South East Asian countries in the last 50 years. Reference is also made to the current theory and practice of Spiritual Care and Counselling, especially as a practice of Christian churches in different countries, predominantly in Indonesia. Previously, it was noticed that there was a lack of knowledge on the above-mentioned field, at least in the European context, but also globally. The author is part of an academic exchange on the subject of Spiritual Counselling between the two regions described: Indonesia (India and Japan attached) and South Africa. The latter is looked at with special regard to Spiritual and/or Pastoral Counselling. The theological frame of reference is Public Theology. It lays foundations, explores and designs the social implications of religious work, especially in multi-religious societies. The book does not aim at giving a perfect survey of the current state of research in the field. It is based on encounters with colleagues, interviews and documents",1928523005,Spirituality in Diversity South East Asia Meets South Africa : Towards a Global View of Spiritual Counselling

127,Living together in multi-ethnic neighbourhoods,The meaning of public spaces for issues of social integration,Karin Peters,"In Western societies, such as the Netherlands, people with different ethnic backgrounds live together in urban areas. This book examines daily life in multi-ethnic neighbourhoods and the meaning of public spaces for social integration. Through observations and interviews in two Dutch cities (Nijmegen and Utrecht) insight is gained into the use and perception of public spaces. Positive experiences in public spaces contribute to feeling at home in a multi-ethnic neighbourhood. Not only intense and lasting contacts, but also fleeting interactions contribute to feeling at home. Experience with diversity contributes to a realistic view of multiculturalism, a view that is based on everyday experiences, with all its positive and negative implications. This, however, does not mean that residents do not use stereotypes or categorizations. However, there is a major difference between the public discourse - which focuses on differences and problems - and everyday encounters, which are perceived as a way to experience and enjoy diversity. Recommendations are that politicians should look at the everyday realities in multi-ethnic neighbourhoods when discussing issues related to multi-ethnic societies. Repeatedly stressing the dichotomy between native and non-native Dutch citizens and focusing on problems, has a negative effect on the everyday lives of people because it produces and reproduces stereotyped images. Integration is not only about non-native Dutch residents adapting themselves to Dutch society: it is also about the extent to which people from various backgrounds live together and feel at home in their neighbourhood.",9789086861903,Living together in multi-ethnic neighbourhoods The meaning of public spaces for issues of social integration

159,Equity and the Constitution,"The Supreme Court, Equitable Relief, and Public Policy",Gary L. McDowell,"Since the landmark desegregation decisions in the Brown vs. Board of Education cases, the proper role of the federal judiciary has been hotly debated. Has the federal judiciary, in its attempt to legislate social policy, overstepped its constitutional boundaries? In this volume, Gary McDowell considers the equity power created by Article III of the Constitution, on which the most controversial decisions of the Supreme Court have rested. He points out the equity was originally understood as an extraordinary means of offering relief to individuals in cases of fraud, accident, mistake, or trust and as a means of ""confining the operation of unjust and partial laws."" It has now been stretched to offer relief to broadly defined social classes. This ""sociological"" understanding, in McDowell's view, has undermined equity as a substantive body of law. He urges a return to the former definition as a means of restraining the reach of federal jurisdiction.",9780226558141,"Equity and the Constitution The Supreme Court, Equitable Relief, and Public Policy"

As regards the part from Mr. Kenrick's pen (Sections I. to V. of Book III.), Mr. Strahan, save for deleting two Articles which the enlargement of Book I. rendered superfluous and some of the authorities cited which seemed to him too numerous for a student's book, has done no more than bring it up to date. Mr. Strahan has to thank many gentlemen for suggestions and criticisms, and especially his friend and former pupil, Mr. Norman Oldham, of the Inner Temple, Barrister-at-Law, who was also kind enough to read the proofs.

These rediscoveries, when brought to bear upon the Utopia and Faerie Queene, illuminate critical though relatively neglected textual passages that have long puzzled scholars.",9780415977050,Equity in English Renaissance Literature Thomas More and Edmund Spenser
