Centuries after our nation was founded on genocide, settler colonialism, and slavery, many Americans are kinda-sorta-maybe waking up to the reality that our racial politics are (still) garbage. But in the midst of this reckoning, widespread denial and misunderstandings about race persist, even as white supremacy and racial injustice are more visible than ever before. Combining no-holds-barred social critique, humorous personal anecdotes, and analysis of the latest interdisciplinary scholarship on systemic racism, sociologist Crystal M. Fleming provides a fresh, accessible, and irreverent take on everything that’s wrong with our “national conversation about race.” Drawing upon critical race theory, as well as her own experiences as a queer black millennial college professor and researcher, Fleming unveils how systemic racism exposes us all to racial ignorance—and provides a road map for transforming our knowledge into concrete social change. Searing, sobering, and urgently needed, How to Be Less Stupid About Race is a truth bomb for your racist relative, friend, or boss, and a call to action for everyone who wants to challenge white supremacy and intersectional oppression.

Sarah Vine, Daily Mail In Woke, Titania McGrath demonstrates how everybody can play their part in the pursuit of social justice. As a millennial icon on the forefront of online activism, Titania is uniquely placed to guide her readers through the often bewildering array of terminology and concepts that constitute twenty-first-century 'wokeness'. These new ideas often leave the general public bemused, particularly if they don't read the Guardian. Being woke is actually much easier than people think. As Titania demonstrates, anyone can be an activist. By simply adding a rainbow flag to your Facebook profile, or calling out an elderly person who doesn't understand what 'non-binary' means, you can change the world for the better. Indeed, social media has now made it possible to show how virtuous you are without having to do anything at all.

Kendi,One World,8/13/2019,2019,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the National Book Award–winning author of Stamped from the Beginning comes a “groundbreaking” (Time) approach to understanding and uprooting racism and inequality in our society—and in ourselves. “The most courageous book to date on the problem of race in the Western mind.”—The New York Times NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review • Time • NPR • The Washington Post • Shelf Awareness • Library Journal • Publishers Weekly • Kirkus Reviews Antiracism is a transformative concept that reorients and reenergizes the conversation about racism—and, even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi takes readers through a widening circle of antiracist ideas—from the most basic concepts to visionary possibilities—that will help readers see all forms of racism clearly, understand their poisonous consequences, and work to oppose them in our systems and in ourselves. Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science with his own personal story of awakening to antiracism. This is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond the awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a just and equitable society. Praise for How to Be an Antiracist “Ibram X. Kendi’s new book, How to Be an Antiracist, couldn’t come at a better time. . . . Kendi has gifted us with a book that is not only an essential instruction manual but also a memoir of the author’s own path from anti-black racism to anti-white racism and, finally, to antiracism. . . . How to Be an Antiracist gives us a clear and compelling way to approach, as Kendi puts it in his introduction, ‘the basic struggle we’re all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human.’ ”—NPR “Kendi dissects why in a society where so few people consider themselves to be racist the divisions and inequalities of racism remain so prevalent. How to Be an Antiracist punctures the myths of a post-racial America, examining what racism really is—and what we should do about it.”—Time",ISBN_13,9.78053E+12,TRUE,FALSE,320,BOOK,Political Science,NOT_MATURE,TRUE,1.7.6.0.preview.2,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6pNbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6pNbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6pNbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780525509295&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6pNbDwAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:9780525509295&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Be_an_Antiracist.html?hl=&id=6pNbDwAAQBAJ,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,NL,PARTIAL,TRUE,FALSE,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,TRUE,http://books.google.nl/books/download/How_to_Be_an_Antiracist-sample-epub.acsm?id=6pNbDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6pNbDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,FALSE,This is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond the awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a just and equitable society.,4,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This book is a must-read for all of us."" - Michelle Alexander, New York Times bestselling author of The New Jim Crow A poetic and powerful memoir about what it means to be a Black woman in America—and the co-founding of a movement that demands justice for all in the land of the free. Raised by a single mother in an impoverished neighborhood in Los Angeles, Patrisse Khan-Cullors experienced firsthand the prejudice and persecution Black Americans endure at the hands of law enforcement. For Patrisse, the most vulnerable people in the country are Black people. Deliberately and ruthlessly targeted by a criminal justice system serving a white privilege agenda, Black people are subjected to unjustifiable racial profiling and police brutality. In 2013, when Trayvon Martin’s killer went free, Patrisse’s outrage led her to co-found Black Lives Matter with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi. Condemned as terrorists and as a threat to America, these loving women founded a hashtag that birthed the movement to demand accountability from the authorities who continually turn a blind eye to the injustices inflicted upon people of Black and Brown skin. Championing human rights in the face of violent racism, Patrisse is a survivor. She transformed her personal pain into political power, giving voice to a people suffering inequality and a movement fueled by her strength and love to tell the country—and the world—that Black Lives Matter. When They Call You a Terrorist is Patrisse Khan-Cullors and asha bandele’s reflection on humanity.

Nobody in power wants to acknowledge this grim reality, but everyone knows it happens—and that the torturers are the police. Three to five new claims are submitted to the Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission of Illinois each week. Four hundred cases are currently pending investigation. Between 1972 and 1991, at least 125 black suspects were tortured by Chicago police officers working under former Police Commander Jon Burge. As the more recent revelations from the Homan Square “black site” show, that brutal period is far from a historical anomaly. For more than fifty years, police officers who took an oath to protect and serve have instead beaten, electrocuted, suffocated, and raped hundreds—perhaps thousands—of Chicago residents. In The Torture Letters, Laurence Ralph chronicles the history of torture in Chicago, the burgeoning activist movement against police violence, and the American public’s complicity in perpetuating torture at home and abroad. Engaging with a long tradition of epistolary meditations on racism in the United States, from James Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time to Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me, Ralph offers in this book a collection of open letters written to protesters, victims, students, and others. Through these moving, questing, enraged letters, Ralph bears witness to police violence that began in Burge’s Area Two and follows the city’s networks of torture to the global War on Terror. From Vietnam to Geneva to Guantanamo Bay—Ralph’s story extends as far as the legacy of American imperialism. Combining insights from fourteen years of research on torture with testimonies of victims of police violence, retired officers, lawyers, and protesters, this is a powerful indictment of police violence and a fierce challenge to all Americans to demand an end to the systems that support it. With compassion and careful skill, Ralph uncovers the tangled connections among law enforcement, the political machine, and the courts in Chicago, amplifying the voices of torture victims who are still with us—and lending a voice to those long deceased.",ISBN_13,9.78023E+12,TRUE,TRUE,248,BOOK,Social Science,NOT_MATURE,TRUE,2.3.2.0.preview.3,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8QjEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8QjEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8QjEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:The+Torture+Letters&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8QjEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8QjEDwAAQBAJ,NL,FOR_SALE,TRUE,19.62,EUR,19.62,EUR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8QjEDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-8QjEDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,1,listPrice,19620000,EUR,NL,PARTIAL,TRUE,FALSE,ALLOWED,TRUE,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Torture_Letters-sample-epub.acsm?id=8QjEDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8QjEDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,FALSE,"Engaging with a long tradition of epistolary meditations on racism in the United States, from James Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time to Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me, Ralph offers in this book a collection of open letters ...",3,1,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Torture_Letters-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8QjEDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,,,447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why did your sister-in-law take umbrage when you asked to touch her hair -- and how do you make it right? How do you explain white privilege to your white, privileged friend? In So You Want to Talk About Race, Ijeoma Oluo guides readers of all races through subjects ranging from intersectionality and affirmative action to ""model minorities"" in an attempt to make the seemingly impossible possible: honest conversations about race and racism, and how they infect almost every aspect of American life.

Cox,,3/8/2021,2021,"When it comes to Confederate monuments, there is no common ground. Polarizing debates over their meaning have intensified into legislative maneuvering to preserve the statues, legal battles to remove them, and rowdy crowds taking matters into their own hands. These conflicts have raged for well over a century--but they've never been as intense as they are today. In this eye-opening narrative of the efforts to raise, preserve, protest, and remove Confederate monuments, Karen L. Cox depicts what these statues meant to those who erected them and how a movement arose to force a reckoning. She lucidly shows the forces that drove white southerners to construct beacons of white supremacy, as well as the ways that antimonument sentiment, largely stifled during the Jim Crow era, returned with the civil rights movement and gathered momentum in the decades after the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Monument defenders responded with gerrymandering and ""heritage"" laws intended to block efforts to remove these statues, but hard as they worked to preserve the Lost Cause vision of southern history, civil rights activists, Black elected officials, and movements of ordinary people fought harder to take the story back. Timely, accessible, and essential, No Common Ground is the story of the seemingly invincible stone sentinels that are just beginning to fall from their pedestals.",ISBN_10,1469662671,FALSE,FALSE,192,BOOK,,NOT_MATURE,FALSE,preview-1.0.0,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R0LazQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R0LazQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=R0LazQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:No+Common+Ground&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=R0LazQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:No+Common+Ground&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/No_Common_Ground.html?hl=&id=R0LazQEACAAJ,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,NL,NO_PAGES,FALSE,FALSE,ALLOWED,FALSE,,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=R0LazQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,NONE,FALSE,Rewriting history in stone -- From bereavement to vindication -- Confederate culture and the struggle for civil rights -- Monuments and the battle for first-class citizenship -- Debating removal in a changing political landscape -- ...,,,,,,725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The centuries-long genocidal program of the US settler-colonial regimen has largely been omitted from history. Now, for the first time, acclaimed historian and activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz offers a history of the United States told from the perspective of Indigenous peoples and reveals how Native Americans, for centuries, actively resisted expansion of the US empire. In An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States, Dunbar-Ortiz adroitly challenges the founding myth of the United States and shows how policy against the Indigenous peoples was colonialist and designed to seize the territories of the original inhabitants, displacing or eliminating them. And as Dunbar-Ortiz reveals, this policy was praised in popular culture, through writers like James Fenimore Cooper and Walt Whitman, and in the highest offices of government and the military. Shockingly, as the genocidal policy reached its zenith under President Andrew Jackson, its ruthlessness was best articulated by US Army general Thomas S. Jesup, who, in 1836, wrote of the Seminoles: “The country can be rid of them only by exterminating them.” Spanning more than four hundred years, this classic bottom-up peoples’ history radically reframes US history and explodes the silences that have haunted our national narrative.",ISBN_13,9.78081E+12,TRUE,FALSE,312,BOOK,History,NOT_MATURE,TRUE,1.5.4.0.preview.2,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZkEoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZkEoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZkEoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT163&dq=intitle:An+Indigenous+Peoples%27+History+of+the+United+States&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZkEoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZkEoAwAAQBAJ,NL,FOR_SALE,TRUE,24.97,EUR,24.97,EUR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZkEoAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZkEoAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,1,listPrice,24970000,EUR,NL,PARTIAL,TRUE,FALSE,ALLOWED,TRUE,http://books.google.nl/books/download/An_Indigenous_Peoples_History_of_the_Uni-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZkEoAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZkEoAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,FALSE,Roosevelt administration&#39;s programs to combat economic collapse included an <br>\nacknowledgment of <b>Indigenous</b> self-determination.

Perfect Mexican daughters do not go away to college. And they do not move out of their parents’ house after high school graduation. Perfect Mexican daughters never abandon their family. But Julia is not your perfect Mexican daughter. That was Olga’s role. Then a tragic accident on the busiest street in Chicago leaves Olga dead and Julia left behind to reassemble the shattered pieces of her family. And no one seems to acknowledge that Julia is broken, too. Instead, her mother seems to channel her grief into pointing out every possible way Julia has failed. But it’s not long before Julia discovers that Olga might not have been as perfect as everyone thought. With the help of her best friend Lorena, and her first love, first everything boyfriend Connor, Julia is determined to find out. Was Olga really what she seemed?

We live in an age of racial equality punctuated by galling examples of ongoing discrimination-from the federal government's inadequate efforts to protect the predominantly black population of New Orleans to Michael Richards's outrageous outburst. Not surprisingly, African-Americans distrust the rhetoric of political correctness, and see instead the threat of racism lurking below every white surface.

It's a surprising assertion. Isn't PC culture all about kindness? About protecting victimized groups? If you trace the history of political correctness, the answer is emphatically no. It has other goals in mind and has since its inception with thinkers like Rousseau. Author Douglas Kruger traces the unfolding ideology from its dark genesis (the French Revolution and subsequent terror) through its various incarnations- Marxism, relativism, post-modernism, and all the way to today's identity-politics. He points out the flaws, fallacies, and in many cases, the body-counts these ideologies have wracked up. Uniquely, this book then goes one step further. It is not merely descriptive history; it is not just explanatory philosophy. This is a debate guide, a how-to manual for those interested in attacking these harmful ideas head on. Do you know how to articulate what is wrong with ""woke"" arguments? Do you know how to defend the Western tradition against relentless onslaught from the PC-Police? Here is how, step by step and argument by argument. Become a master at identifying, debunking, and dismantling dangerous ideas. Add your voice to the culture wars and learn precisely how to fight for tried and tested Western values-values like science, democracy, logic, rule of law, and the Judeo-Christian tradition of human rights and values.

Ellis,Encounter Books,3/17/2020,2020,"A series of near-riots on campuses aimed at silencing guest speakers has exposed the fact that our universities are no longer devoted to the free exchange of ideas in pursuit of truth. But this hostility to free speech is only a symptom of a deeper problem, writes John Ellis. Having watched the deterioration of academia up close for the past fifty years, Ellis locates the core of the problem in a change in the composition of the faculty during this time, from mildly left-leaning to almost exclusively leftist. He explains how astonishing historical luck led to the success of a plan first devised by a small group of activists to use college campuses to promote radical politics, and why laws and regulations designed to prevent the politicizing of higher education proved insufficient. Ellis shows that political motivation is always destructive of higher learning. Even science and technology departments are not immune. The corruption of universities by radical politics also does wider damage: to primary and secondary education, to race relations, to preparation for the workplace, and to the political and social fabric of the nation. Commonly suggested remedies—new free-speech rules, or enforced right-of-center appointments—will fail because they don’t touch the core problem, a controlling faculty majority of political activists with no real interest in scholarship. This book proposes more drastic and effective reform measures. The first step is for Americans to recognize that vast sums of public money intended for education are being diverted to a political agenda, and to demand that this fraud be stopped.",ISBN_13,9.78164E+12,TRUE,TRUE,224,BOOK,Education,NOT_MATURE,TRUE,1.2.2.0.preview.3,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781641770897&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ,NL,FOR_SALE,TRUE,26.99,EUR,18.89,EUR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,1,listPrice,26990000,EUR,NL,PARTIAL,TRUE,FALSE,ALLOWED,TRUE,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Breakdown_of_Higher_Education-sample-epub.acsm?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,FALSE,This book proposes more drastic and effective reform measures.,,,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Breakdown_of_Higher_Education-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Colonialism was a blight upon the planet, right? The problems in the world can all be traced back to the white man, right? Slavery is the biggest sin ever perpetrated upon the globe and was carried out by the white man, right? Multiculturalism is something we simply have to adjust to, right? Political correctness is the rule to live by, right? Truth is the new hate speech, right? If this is the content of the messages that reach your eyes and ears every day, but you are not quite sure of how true or right they are, or how you should react to them, this book is for you. And it goes a lot further, as it deals with pressing social issues such as the Islamization of Europe, the coming New World Order, and what it entails. Does it concern you that men are marrying men? Does it concern you that the Pope supports both gay rights and Islam, and says that God is not divine? How do you feel about the drive toward the unity of all churches under the aegis of the Pope? Are you happy about being herded into a global religious ecumenical hug? Wasn't America built on the premise of escaping papal persecution? Is Sunday the real Sabbath? Is uniting with Catholicism the best option for America and the West? Is the separation of church and state really a metaphor based on bad history, that Trump is vowing to dismantle? What about the radical fraying of the fabric of society, and the downward spiral in morality? Perhaps we need to take a little step back and retrace our steps up to the present. White civilization took over the world, and it was self-consciously Christian at the time. Maybe we need to go back to the Bible, and connect the dots between what it says and the impact made by white civilization upon history. This book is entirely unique and is of particular relevance to the times in which we live. It is entirely unique for two reasons. First, it links Western Christian civilization - Modern Israel - to the Bible and shows how the West fulfilled all the promises God made to Abraham about taking over large swathes of the world - so as to bring the conquered to a knowledge of the truth of God, and so that ""through you, all nations of the earth will be blessed."" Second, it shows how the West reneged on its God-given responsibility and adopted the idea of evolution as our story of origin. As long as the West held to the Great Commission that they were given to ""Go and teach all nations..."" there was reason, purpose and justification for the colonization of the world. The colonial era, despite all its negative propaganda, was the greatest force for good ever to operate upon the planet. But as soon as the West let go of the Bible and embraced evolution as our origin, the reasons for our expansionism evaporated, the justification for our wealth and prosperity evaporated, and we began to sink into the slime from which we claimed to have emerged. But despite all the hoopla, there is to this day, absolutely no scientific proof for evolution. Anyone who doubts evolution is made to feel ignorant and stupid. It was the belief in the Bible that brought the West to the heights of its cultural preeminence. At the height of our power we had the opportunity to tell everyone how they too could flourish as we were flourishing. But instead of pride in the validity of our beliefs, we began to feel guilty about our success, and White Guilt became the hallmark of the Western world. In order to cope with our guilt, we elevated all cultures to having the same value as our own, and multiculturalism became the benchmark of a supposedly fair and balanced approach to the world. Hot on the heels of multiculturalism, came political correctness which, with its myriad of conflicting claims to having the right to feel insulted, freedom of speech has become radically undermined, and we end up wondering what we are allowed to say next.

John M. Ellis here scrutinizes the new regime in humanistic studies. He offers a careful, intelligent analysis that exposes the weaknesses of notions that are fashionable in humanities today. In a clear voice, with forceful logic, he speaks out against the orthodoxy that has installed race, gender, and class perspectives at the center of college humanities curricula. Ellis begins by showing that political correctness is a recurring impulse of Western society and one that has a discouraging history. He reveals the contradictions and misconceptions that surround the new orthodoxy and demonstrates how it is most deficient just where it imagines itself to be superior. Ellis contends that humanistic education today, far from being historically aware, relies on anachronistic thinking; far from being skeptical of Western values, represents a ruthless and unskeptical Western extremism; far from being valuable in bringing political perspectives to bear, presents politics that are crude and unreal; far from being sophisticated in matters of ""theory,"" is largely ignorant of the range and history of critical theory; far from valuing diversity, is unable to respond to the great sweep of literature.

The global warming lobby, relentless in its push for bigger government, more spending, and more regulation, will use any means necessary to scare you out of your wits--as well as your tax dollars and your liberties--with threats of rising oceans, deadly droughts, and unspeakable future consequences of ""climate change."" In pursuing their anti-energy, anti-capitalist, and pro-government agenda, the global warming alarmists--and unscrupulous scientists who see this scare as their gravy train to federal grants and foundation money--resort to dirty tricks, smear campaigns, and outright lies, abandoning scientific standards, journalistic integrity, and the old-fashioned notions of free speech and open debate. In Red Hot Lies, bestselling author Christopher Horner--himself the target of Greenpeace dirty tricks and alarmist smears--exposes the dark underbelly of the environmental movement. Power-hungry politicians blacklist scientists who reject global warming alarmism. U.S. senators threaten companies that fund climate change dissenters. Mainstream media outlets openly reject the notion of ""balance."" The occasional unguarded scientist candidly admits the need to twist the facts to paint an uglier picture in order to keep the faucet of government money flowing. In the name of ""saving the planet,"" anything goes. But why the nasty tactics? Why the cover ups, lies, and intimidation? Because Al Gore and his ilk want to use big government at the local, state, federal, and global level to run your life, and they can brook no opposition.

It’s a surprising assertion. Isn’t PC culture all about kindness? About protecting victimized groups? If you trace the history of political correctness, the answer is emphatically no. It has other goals in mind and has since its inception with thinkers like Rousseau. Author Douglas Kruger traces the unfolding ideology from its dark genesis (the French Revolution and subsequent terror) through its various incarnations— Marxism, relativism, post-modernism, and all the way to today’s identity-politics. He points out the flaws, fallacies, and in many cases, the body-counts these ideologies have wracked up. Uniquely, this book then goes one step further.

Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising. Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and afraid to speak honestly. How did this happen? First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three Great Untruths are incompatible with basic psychological principles, as well as ancient wisdom from many cultures. They interfere with healthy development. Anyone who embraces these untruths—and the resulting culture of safetyism—is less likely to become an autonomous adult able to navigate the bumpy road of life. Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to produce these untruths. They situate the conflicts on campus in the context of America’s rapidly rising political polarization, including a rise in hate crimes and off-campus provocation. They explore changes in childhood including the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade.

Schwartz,Springer,9/20/2016,2016,"This book develops a psychoanalytic theory of political correctness and the pristine self, which is defined as a self touched by nothing but love. It explores the damage that political correctness can do to social order. Applications include the breakdown of social capital, the financial crisis, and Occupy Wall Street. Long an issue for conservatives, alarm over political correctness has now spread to the liberal side of the political spectrum. As Schwartz argues, all have reason to be concerned. The psychology that underlies political correctness has the potential to be extremely destructive to social organization on every level. Schwartz discusses the primitive roots of political correctness and, through the use of case studies, shows its capacity for ruination. The book focuses on a transformation in the idea of the self, and specifically the rise of the pristine self. The problem is that, in truth, the world does not love us.

Surrounded by Idiots is an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide. It offers a simple, yet ground-breaking method for assessing the personalities of people we communicate with – in and out of the office – based on four personality types (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), and provides insights into how we can adjust the way we speak and share information. Erikson will help you understand yourself better, hone communication and social skills, handle conflict with confidence, improve dynamics with your boss and team, and get the best out of the people you deal with and manage. He also shares simple tricks on body language, improving written communication, advice on when to back away or when to push on, and when to speak up or shut up. Packed with ‘aha!’ and ‘oh no!’ moments, Surrounded by Idiots will help you understand and communicate with those around you, even people you currently think are beyond all comprehension. And with a bit of luck you can also be confident that the idiot out there isn’t you!",ISBN_13,9.78125E+12,TRUE,FALSE,288,BOOK,Business & Economics,NOT_MATURE,TRUE,1.6.6.0.preview.2,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mo1xDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mo1xDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mo1xDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781250179951&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mo1xDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mo1xDwAAQBAJ,NL,FOR_SALE,TRUE,9.34,EUR,6.35,EUR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mo1xDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mo1xDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,1,listPrice,9340000,EUR,NL,PARTIAL,TRUE,FALSE,ALLOWED,TRUE,http://books.google.nl/books/download/Surrounded_by_Idiots-sample-epub.acsm?id=mo1xDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mo1xDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,FALSE,"Surrounded by Idiots is an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide.",3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abigail Shrier, a Wall Street Journal writer, does something simple yet devastating: she rigorously lays out the facts."" —Janice Turner, The Times of London Until just a few years ago, gender dysphoria—severe discomfort in one’s biological sex—was vanishingly rare. It was typically found in less than .01 percent of the population, emerged in early childhood, and afflicted males almost exclusively. But today whole groups of female friends in colleges, high schools, and even middle schools across the country are coming out as “transgender.” These are girls who had never experienced any discomfort in their biological sex until they heard a coming-out story from a speaker at a school assembly or discovered the internet community of trans “influencers.” Unsuspecting parents are awakening to find their daughters in thrall to hip trans YouTube stars and “gender-affirming” educators and therapists who push life-changing interventions on young girls—including medically unnecessary double mastectomies and puberty blockers that can cause permanent infertility. Abigail Shrier, a writer for the Wall Street Journal, has dug deep into the trans epidemic, talking to the girls, their agonized parents, and the counselors and doctors who enable gender transitions, as well as to “detransitioners”—young women who bitterly regret what they have done to themselves. Coming out as transgender immediately boosts these girls’ social status, Shrier finds, but once they take the first steps of transition, it is not easy to walk back. She offers urgently needed advice about how parents can protect their daughters. A generation of girls is at risk.

For instance, we’re told that: •Boys who think they’re girls (and who could change their minds tomorrow) should be allowed to participate in girls’ sports—and shower in their locker rooms •Expectant mothers are now “birthing individuals” •Coed college dorm rooms and bathrooms are great, but single-sex clubs are a campus danger •It’s horrible for stores to have separate boys and girls clothing departments (let alone toy sections) •It would be a great idea for our military to lower physical standards and push young women and mothers into combat roles in the military If you think that’s insanity, you’re not alone, but you might be surprised at just how widespread—and successful—this lunatic campaign has become. In her compelling new book, Sex Scandal, journalist Ashley McGuire takes this radical campaign to task and reveals: •How so-called “gender-norming” flies in the face of science (which is proving that men and women are even more different than commonly acknowledged) •Why—especially if you have kids—it’s almost impossible to avoid the dangerous consequences of a “gender neutral” world •How embracing sexual differences can make policing safer, government more efficient—and hedge funds lose less money •How “gender neutrality” is making women more vulnerable to violence •How the word “gender”—formerly a grammatical term—has been used to dismiss the reality of definite, biological “sex” (male and female) with fluid “gender identities” •Why “gender” insanity is not something we can just ignore and hope will fade away, but need to refute—now—with hard, cold facts before it does any more damage (which it likely will) Sex Scandal: The Drive to Abolish Male and Female is packed with news-breaking interviews, shocking examples, and “inconvenient” facts that everyone needs to read—and act on.",ISBN_13,9.78162E+12,TRUE,FALSE,256,BOOK,Social Science,NOT_MATURE,TRUE,1.5.6.0.preview.2,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781621576105&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ,NL,FOR_SALE,TRUE,15.02,EUR,15.02,EUR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YFL5DQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,1,listPrice,15020000,EUR,NL,PARTIAL,TRUE,FALSE,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,TRUE,http://books.google.nl/books/download/Sex_Scandal-sample-epub.acsm?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,FALSE,"In her compelling new book, Sex Scandal, journalist Ashley McGuire takes this radical campaign to task and reveals: •How so-called “gender-norming” flies in the face of science (which is proving that men and women are even more ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But now, as Roger Kimball reveals in this witty and provocative book, the student is less likely to learn about the aesthetics of masterworks than to be told, for instance, that Peter Paul Rubens' great painting Drunken Silenus is an allegory about anal rape. Or that Courbet's famous hunting pictures are psychodramas about ""castration anxiety."" Or that Gauguin's Manao tupapau is an example of the way repression is ""written on the bodies of women."" Or that Jan van Eyck's masterful Arnolfini Portrait is about ""middle-class deceptions ... and the treatment of women."" Or that Mark Rothko's abstract White Band (Number 27) ""parallels the pictorial structure of a pieta."" Or that Winslow Homer's The Gulf Stream is ""a visual encoding of racism."" In ""The Rape of the Masters: How Political Correctness Sabotages Art,"" Kimball, a noted art critic himself, shows how academic art history is increasingly held hostage to radical cultural politics--feminism, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, the whole armory of academic antihumanism. To make his point, he describes how eight famous works of art (reprinted here as illustrations) have been made over to fit a radical ideological fantasy. Kimball then performs a series of intellectual rescue operations, explaining how these great works should be understood through a series of illuminating readings in which art, not politics, guides the discussion. ""The Rape of the Masters"" exposes the charlatanry that fuels much academic art history and leaks into the art world generally, affecting galleries, museums and catalogues. It also provides an engaging antidote to the tendentious, politically motivated assaults on our treasured sources of culture and civilization.",ISBN_13,9.78159E+12,TRUE,TRUE,186,BOOK,Art,NOT_MATURE,FALSE,0.1.1.0.preview.3,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3z45znso5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3z45znso5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N3z45znso5cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781594031212&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N3z45znso5cC&dq=isbn:9781594031212&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Rape_of_the_Masters.html?hl=&id=N3z45znso5cC,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,NL,PARTIAL,TRUE,FALSE,ALLOWED,TRUE,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Rape_of_the_Masters-sample-epub.acsm?id=N3z45znso5cC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=N3z45znso5cC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,FALSE,"In this witty and provocative book, a noted art critic shows how academic art history is increasingly held hostage to radical cultural politics--feminism, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, and the whole armory of academic antihumanism ...",3,1,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Rape_of_the_Masters-sample-pdf.acsm?id=N3z45znso5cC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the space of a year, it's gone from something that most Americans had never heard of to a cause claiming the mantle of civil rights. But can a boy truly be ""trapped"" in a girl's body? Can modern medicine really ""reassign"" sex? Is sex something ""assigned"" in the first place? What's the loving response to a friend or child experiencing a gender-identity conflict? What should our law say on these issues? When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment provides thoughtful answers to all of these questions. Drawing on the best insights from biology, psychology, and philosophy, Ryan T. Anderson offers a balanced approach to the policy issues, a nuanced vision of human embodiment, and a sober and honest survey of the human costs of getting human nature wrong. He reveals a grim contrast between the media's sunny depiction and the often sad realities of gender-identity struggles. He introduces readers to people who tried to ""transition"" but found themselves no better off. Especially troubling is the suffering felt by adults who were encouraged to transition as children but later came to regret it. And there is a reason that many do regret it. As Anderson shows, the most helpful therapies focus not on achieving the impossible--changing bodies to conform to thoughts and feelings--but on helping people accept and even embrace the truth about their bodies and reality. This discussion will be of particular interest to parents who fear how an ideological school counselor might try to steer their child. The best evidence shows that the vast majority of children naturally grow out of any gender-conflicted phase. But no one knows how new school policies might affect children indoctrinated to believe that they really are trapped in the ""wrong"" body. Throughout the book, Anderson highlights the various contradictions at the heart of this moment: How it embraces the gnostic idea that the real self is something other than the body, while also embracing the idea that nothing but the physical exists. How it relies on rigid sex stereotypes--in which dolls are for girls and trucks are for boys--while also insisting that gender is purely a social construct, and that there are no meaningful differences between women and men. How it assumes that feelings of identity deserve absolute respect, while the facts of our embodiment do not. How it preaches that people should be free to do as they please and define their own truth--while enforcing a ruthless campaign to coerce anyone who dares to dissent. Everyone has something at stake in today's debates about gender identity. Analyzing education and employment policies, Obama-era bathroom and locker-room mandates, politically correct speech codes and religious-freedom violations, Anderson shows how the law is being used to coerce and penalize those who believe the truth about human nature. And he shows how Americans can begin to push back with principle and prudence, compassion and grace.",ISBN_10,1594039615,FALSE,FALSE,,BOOK,,NOT_MATURE,FALSE,preview-1.0.0,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781594039614&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781594039614&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/When_Harry_Became_Sally.html?hl=&id=dS1cAQAACAAJ,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,NL,NO_PAGES,FALSE,FALSE,ALLOWED,FALSE,,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,NONE,FALSE,"What should our law say on these issues?

Paltridge,Taylor Trade Publications,6/16/2010,2010,"So you think the theory of disastrous climate change has been proven? You believe scientists are united in their efforts to affect a reduction in carbon emissions? You trust that scientists are far too professional to overstate their case? Maybe we should all think again. In The Climate Caper, written with a light touch and a readable manner, Garth Paltridge shows that the case for action against climate change is not nearly so clear cut after all. He leads us through the inherent problems of the climate modeling process, as well as the uncertainties associated with economic forecasts of climatic doom. Paltridge uncovers the conscious and subconscious forces that hide skepticism within the scientific community from the public eye and submit governments to a scientific and technological elite-an elite that achieves its ends by manipulating the public through fear of climate change, creating the world's greatest example of a religion for the politically correct.",ISBN_13,9.78159E+12,TRUE,TRUE,120,BOOK,Science,NOT_MATURE,FALSE,0.1.3.0.preview.3,FALSE,FALSE,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781589795495&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&dq=isbn:9781589795495&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Climate_Caper.html?hl=&id=XYK_mrKg1V4C,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,NL,PARTIAL,TRUE,FALSE,ALLOWED,TRUE,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Climate_Caper-sample-epub.acsm?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,FALSE,"Maybe we should all think again.
