She empowers the independent spirit in all of us, telling it like it is... from the fact that personal rights carry personal responsibility to today's rampant racism, divisiveness, and the addiction epidemic plaguing our nation.

Crimes motivated by racism are punished with particular severity, and Americans are more sensitive than ever about the words they choose when talking about race. And yet America remains divided along the color line. Acclaimed scholar John L. Jackson, Jr., identifies a new paradigm of race relations that has emerged in the wake of the legal victories of the civil rights era: racial paranoia. We live in an age of racial equality punctuated by galling examples of ongoing discrimination-from the federal government's inadequate efforts to protect the predominantly black population of New Orleans to Michael Richards's outrageous outburst. Not surprisingly, African-Americans distrust the rhetoric of political correctness, and see instead the threat of racism lurking below every white surface. Conspiracy theories abound and racial reconciliation seems near to impossible.

It's a surprising assertion. Isn't PC culture all about kindness? About protecting victimized groups? If you trace the history of political correctness, the answer is emphatically no. It has other goals in mind and has since its inception with thinkers like Rousseau. Author Douglas Kruger traces the unfolding ideology from its dark genesis (the French Revolution and subsequent terror) through its various incarnations- Marxism, relativism, post-modernism, and all the way to today's identity-politics. He points out the flaws, fallacies, and in many cases, the body-counts these ideologies have wracked up. Uniquely, this book then goes one step further. It is not merely descriptive history; it is not just explanatory philosophy. This is a debate guide, a how-to manual for those interested in attacking these harmful ideas head on. Do you know how to articulate what is wrong with ""woke"" arguments? Do you know how to defend the Western tradition against relentless onslaught from the PC-Police? Here is how, step by step and argument by argument. Become a master at identifying, debunking, and dismantling dangerous ideas. Add your voice to the culture wars and learn precisely how to fight for tried and tested Western values-values like science, democracy, logic, rule of law, and the Judeo-Christian tradition of human rights and values.

Ellis,Encounter Books,2020-03-17,"A series of near-riots on campuses aimed at silencing guest speakers has exposed the fact that our universities are no longer devoted to the free exchange of ideas in pursuit of truth. But this hostility to free speech is only a symptom of a deeper problem, writes John Ellis. Having watched the deterioration of academia up close for the past fifty years, Ellis locates the core of the problem in a change in the composition of the faculty during this time, from mildly left-leaning to almost exclusively leftist. He explains how astonishing historical luck led to the success of a plan first devised by a small group of activists to use college campuses to promote radical politics, and why laws and regulations designed to prevent the politicizing of higher education proved insufficient. Ellis shows that political motivation is always destructive of higher learning. Even science and technology departments are not immune. The corruption of universities by radical politics also does wider damage: to primary and secondary education, to race relations, to preparation for the workplace, and to the political and social fabric of the nation. Commonly suggested remedies—new free-speech rules, or enforced right-of-center appointments—will fail because they don’t touch the core problem, a controlling faculty majority of political activists with no real interest in scholarship. This book proposes more drastic and effective reform measures. The first step is for Americans to recognize that vast sums of public money intended for education are being diverted to a political agenda, and to demand that this fraud be stopped.",ISBN_13,9781641770897,True,True,224.0,BOOK,NOT_MATURE,True,1.2.2.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781641770897&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ,NL,FOR_SALE,True,NL,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,This book proposes more drastic and effective reform measures.,Education,,,26.99,EUR,18.89,EUR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,1.0,listPrice,26990000.0,EUR,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Breakdown_of_Higher_Education-sample-epub.acsm?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Breakdown_of_Higher_Education-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Lz3DDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,,

Colonialism was a blight upon the planet, right? The problems in the world can all be traced back to the white man, right? Slavery is the biggest sin ever perpetrated upon the globe and was carried out by the white man, right? Multiculturalism is something we simply have to adjust to, right? Political correctness is the rule to live by, right? Truth is the new hate speech, right? If this is the content of the messages that reach your eyes and ears every day, but you are not quite sure of how true or right they are, or how you should react to them, this book is for you. And it goes a lot further, as it deals with pressing social issues such as the Islamization of Europe, the coming New World Order, and what it entails. Does it concern you that men are marrying men? Does it concern you that the Pope supports both gay rights and Islam, and says that God is not divine? How do you feel about the drive toward the unity of all churches under the aegis of the Pope? Are you happy about being herded into a global religious ecumenical hug? Wasn't America built on the premise of escaping papal persecution? Is Sunday the real Sabbath? Is uniting with Catholicism the best option for America and the West? Is the separation of church and state really a metaphor based on bad history, that Trump is vowing to dismantle? What about the radical fraying of the fabric of society, and the downward spiral in morality? Perhaps we need to take a little step back and retrace our steps up to the present. White civilization took over the world, and it was self-consciously Christian at the time. Maybe we need to go back to the Bible, and connect the dots between what it says and the impact made by white civilization upon history. This book is entirely unique and is of particular relevance to the times in which we live. It is entirely unique for two reasons. First, it links Western Christian civilization - Modern Israel - to the Bible and shows how the West fulfilled all the promises God made to Abraham about taking over large swathes of the world - so as to bring the conquered to a knowledge of the truth of God, and so that ""through you, all nations of the earth will be blessed."" Second, it shows how the West reneged on its God-given responsibility and adopted the idea of evolution as our story of origin. As long as the West held to the Great Commission that they were given to ""Go and teach all nations..."" there was reason, purpose and justification for the colonization of the world. The colonial era, despite all its negative propaganda, was the greatest force for good ever to operate upon the planet. But as soon as the West let go of the Bible and embraced evolution as our origin, the reasons for our expansionism evaporated, the justification for our wealth and prosperity evaporated, and we began to sink into the slime from which we claimed to have emerged. But despite all the hoopla, there is to this day, absolutely no scientific proof for evolution. Anyone who doubts evolution is made to feel ignorant and stupid. It was the belief in the Bible that brought the West to the heights of its cultural preeminence. At the height of our power we had the opportunity to tell everyone how they too could flourish as we were flourishing. But instead of pride in the validity of our beliefs, we began to feel guilty about our success, and White Guilt became the hallmark of the Western world. In order to cope with our guilt, we elevated all cultures to having the same value as our own, and multiculturalism became the benchmark of a supposedly fair and balanced approach to the world. Hot on the heels of multiculturalism, came political correctness which, with its myriad of conflicting claims to having the right to feel insulted, freedom of speech has become radically undermined, and we end up wondering what we are allowed to say next.

John M. Ellis here scrutinizes the new regime in humanistic studies. He offers a careful, intelligent analysis that exposes the weaknesses of notions that are fashionable in humanities today. In a clear voice, with forceful logic, he speaks out against the orthodoxy that has installed race, gender, and class perspectives at the center of college humanities curricula. Ellis begins by showing that political correctness is a recurring impulse of Western society and one that has a discouraging history. He reveals the contradictions and misconceptions that surround the new orthodoxy and demonstrates how it is most deficient just where it imagines itself to be superior. Ellis contends that humanistic education today, far from being historically aware, relies on anachronistic thinking; far from being skeptical of Western values, represents a ruthless and unskeptical Western extremism; far from being valuable in bringing political perspectives to bear, presents politics that are crude and unreal; far from being sophisticated in matters of ""theory,"" is largely ignorant of the range and history of critical theory; far from valuing diversity, is unable to respond to the great sweep of literature.

At this critical time in our history, it is imperative that conservatives stand united against this assault. The majority of Americans are not progressive liberals, so why should we have to live with progressive liberal policies? Charles Gross thinks it's time to fi ght for individual liberties and America's future. He makes a case for the following: Liberals consistently say one thing and do another. Liberal politicians blatantly promote racism and divisiveness. Progressive liberal concepts enable the Islamic agenda of global domination. Many moderate Americans support liberal candidates, voting against their own best interests. Republican politicians contribute to the problem by failing to act with integrity and according to the Constitution. Gross proposes achievable solutions to restore traditional American values. By reducing the size of the federal government, reforming taxation, maintaining a strong national defense, and applying the tenets of the United States Constitution along with common sense, it is possible to save America from progressive liberalism.",ISBN_10,1462005438,False,False,200.0,BOOK,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EKcnKQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EKcnKQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=EKcnKQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781462005437&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=EKcnKQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781462005437&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Danger_of_Progressive_Liberalism.html?hl=&id=EKcnKQEACAAJ,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,NL,NO_PAGES,False,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EKcnKQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,NONE,False,"The majority of Americans are not progressive liberals, so why should we have to live with progressive liberal policies?

Horner,Simon and Schuster,2008-11-11,"Liars--Al Gore, the United Nations, the New York Times. The global warming lobby, relentless in its push for bigger government, more spending, and more regulation, will use any means necessary to scare you out of your wits--as well as your tax dollars and your liberties--with threats of rising oceans, deadly droughts, and unspeakable future consequences of ""climate change."" In pursuing their anti-energy, anti-capitalist, and pro-government agenda, the global warming alarmists--and unscrupulous scientists who see this scare as their gravy train to federal grants and foundation money--resort to dirty tricks, smear campaigns, and outright lies, abandoning scientific standards, journalistic integrity, and the old-fashioned notions of free speech and open debate. In Red Hot Lies, bestselling author Christopher Horner--himself the target of Greenpeace dirty tricks and alarmist smears--exposes the dark underbelly of the environmental movement. Power-hungry politicians blacklist scientists who reject global warming alarmism. U.S. senators threaten companies that fund climate change dissenters. Mainstream media outlets openly reject the notion of ""balance."" The occasional unguarded scientist candidly admits the need to twist the facts to paint an uglier picture in order to keep the faucet of government money flowing. In the name of ""saving the planet,"" anything goes. But why the nasty tactics? Why the cover ups, lies, and intimidation? Because Al Gore and his ilk want to use big government at the local, state, federal, and global level to run your life, and they can brook no opposition.

It’s a surprising assertion. Isn’t PC culture all about kindness? About protecting victimized groups? If you trace the history of political correctness, the answer is emphatically no. It has other goals in mind and has since its inception with thinkers like Rousseau. Author Douglas Kruger traces the unfolding ideology from its dark genesis (the French Revolution and subsequent terror) through its various incarnations— Marxism, relativism, post-modernism, and all the way to today’s identity-politics. He points out the flaws, fallacies, and in many cases, the body-counts these ideologies have wracked up. Uniquely, this book then goes one step further. It is not merely descriptive history; it is not just explanatory philosophy. This is a debate guide, a how-to manual for those interested in attacking these harmful ideas head on. Do you know how to articulate what is wrong with “woke” arguments? Do you know how to defend the Western tradition against relentless onslaught from the PC-Police? Here is how, step by step and argument by argument. Become a master at identifying, debunking, and dismantling dangerous ideas. Add your voice to the culture wars and learn precisely how to fight for tried and tested Western values—values like science, democracy, logic, rule of law, and the Judeo-Christian tradition of human rights and values. As it turns out, you can have truth, or you can have political correctness, but you can’t have both.

Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising. Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and afraid to speak honestly. How did this happen? First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three Great Untruths are incompatible with basic psychological principles, as well as ancient wisdom from many cultures. They interfere with healthy development. Anyone who embraces these untruths—and the resulting culture of safetyism—is less likely to become an autonomous adult able to navigate the bumpy road of life. Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to produce these untruths. They situate the conflicts on campus in the context of America’s rapidly rising political polarization, including a rise in hate crimes and off-campus provocation. They explore changes in childhood including the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade. This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines.",ISBN_13,9780735224902,True,False,352.0,BOOK,NOT_MATURE,True,1.21.16.0.preview.2,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780735224902&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:9780735224902&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Coddling_of_the_American_Mind.html?hl=&id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,NL,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,True,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines.",Social Science,4.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Coddling_of_the_American_Mind-sample-epub.acsm?id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,Jonathan Haidt,,,

Schwartz,Springer,2016-09-20,"This book develops a psychoanalytic theory of political correctness and the pristine self, which is defined as a self touched by nothing but love. It explores the damage that political correctness can do to social order. Applications include the breakdown of social capital, the financial crisis, and Occupy Wall Street. Long an issue for conservatives, alarm over political correctness has now spread to the liberal side of the political spectrum. As Schwartz argues, all have reason to be concerned. The psychology that underlies political correctness has the potential to be extremely destructive to social organization on every level. Schwartz discusses the primitive roots of political correctness and, through the use of case studies, shows its capacity for ruination. The book focuses on a transformation in the idea of the self, and specifically the rise of the pristine self. The problem is that, in truth, the world does not love us.

Or tried to reason with your partner with disastrous results? Do long, rambling answers drive you crazy? Or does your colleague’s abrasive manner rub you the wrong way? You are not alone. After a disastrous meeting with a highly successful entrepreneur, who was genuinely convinced he was ‘surrounded by idiots’, communication expert and bestselling author, Thomas Erikson dedicated himself to understanding how people function and why we often struggle to connect with certain types of people. Surrounded by Idiots is an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide. It offers a simple, yet ground-breaking method for assessing the personalities of people we communicate with – in and out of the office – based on four personality types (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), and provides insights into how we can adjust the way we speak and share information. Erikson will help you understand yourself better, hone communication and social skills, handle conflict with confidence, improve dynamics with your boss and team, and get the best out of the people you deal with and manage. He also shares simple tricks on body language, improving written communication, advice on when to back away or when to push on, and when to speak up or shut up. Packed with ‘aha!’ and ‘oh no!’ moments, Surrounded by Idiots will help you understand and communicate with those around you, even people you currently think are beyond all comprehension.

It meets our core mammalian needs for resources, status, and the safety of a herd. I learned to meet my mammalian needs in new ways instead of living in fear of PC gatekeepers. This book shows you how to feel safe when conformity surrounds you.You care about the greater good, but you want to define it for yourself. What if you disagree with the politically correct view? You fear ridicule, shunning and attack, so you tell yourself it¿s not worth it and find a way to conform. Until one day you can't.I was politically correct until the day I heard myself lie about a simple fact because the truth didn't sound progressive. I froze in the middle of a lecture to 150 students. Enough! I decided to take back my brain. I gave myself permission to see what I see and know what I know instead of living in fear. It cost me, but the benefits outweighed the costs. I transitioned and you can too.What do I mean by Political Correctness?I do not mean the hot-button dramas that fill the headlines. They are just tribal solidarity rituals. I mean the belief that we are suffering under a bad system.Political correctness trains you to feel victimized by bad guys running the bad system, and to fight them by following the leaders of political correctness. If you follow, you get to be one of the good guys and share in the rewards that these leaders control. If you don't follow, you are labelled a bad guy and excommunicated.This message is so pervasive that we take it for granted. But I saw that the good guys are not all good and the bad guys are not all bad. I tried to overlook the inconvenient facts because I feared excommunication.

Abigail Shrier, a Wall Street Journal writer, does something simple yet devastating: she rigorously lays out the facts."" —Janice Turner, The Times of London Until just a few years ago, gender dysphoria—severe discomfort in one’s biological sex—was vanishingly rare. It was typically found in less than .01 percent of the population, emerged in early childhood, and afflicted males almost exclusively. But today whole groups of female friends in colleges, high schools, and even middle schools across the country are coming out as “transgender.” These are girls who had never experienced any discomfort in their biological sex until they heard a coming-out story from a speaker at a school assembly or discovered the internet community of trans “influencers.” Unsuspecting parents are awakening to find their daughters in thrall to hip trans YouTube stars and “gender-affirming” educators and therapists who push life-changing interventions on young girls—including medically unnecessary double mastectomies and puberty blockers that can cause permanent infertility. Abigail Shrier, a writer for the Wall Street Journal, has dug deep into the trans epidemic, talking to the girls, their agonized parents, and the counselors and doctors who enable gender transitions, as well as to “detransitioners”—young women who bitterly regret what they have done to themselves. Coming out as transgender immediately boosts these girls’ social status, Shrier finds, but once they take the first steps of transition, it is not easy to walk back. She offers urgently needed advice about how parents can protect their daughters. A generation of girls is at risk.

But now, contrary to all science and common sense, we’re supposed to believe that there is no difference. (And if you insist there is, you just might be accused of a hate crime!) Our culture—and our laws—are endorsing a worldview rooted in craziness. For instance, we’re told that: •Boys who think they’re girls (and who could change their minds tomorrow) should be allowed to participate in girls’ sports—and shower in their locker rooms •Expectant mothers are now “birthing individuals” •Coed college dorm rooms and bathrooms are great, but single-sex clubs are a campus danger •It’s horrible for stores to have separate boys and girls clothing departments (let alone toy sections) •It would be a great idea for our military to lower physical standards and push young women and mothers into combat roles in the military If you think that’s insanity, you’re not alone, but you might be surprised at just how widespread—and successful—this lunatic campaign has become. In her compelling new book, Sex Scandal, journalist Ashley McGuire takes this radical campaign to task and reveals: •How so-called “gender-norming” flies in the face of science (which is proving that men and women are even more different than commonly acknowledged) •Why—especially if you have kids—it’s almost impossible to avoid the dangerous consequences of a “gender neutral” world •How embracing sexual differences can make policing safer, government more efficient—and hedge funds lose less money •How “gender neutrality” is making women more vulnerable to violence •How the word “gender”—formerly a grammatical term—has been used to dismiss the reality of definite, biological “sex” (male and female) with fluid “gender identities” •Why “gender” insanity is not something we can just ignore and hope will fade away, but need to refute—now—with hard, cold facts before it does any more damage (which it likely will) Sex Scandal: The Drive to Abolish Male and Female is packed with news-breaking interviews, shocking examples, and “inconvenient” facts that everyone needs to read—and act on.",ISBN_13,9781621576105,True,False,256.0,BOOK,NOT_MATURE,True,1.5.6.0.preview.2,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781621576105&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ,NL,FOR_SALE,True,NL,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,True,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"In her compelling new book, Sex Scandal, journalist Ashley McGuire takes this radical campaign to task and reveals: •How so-called “gender-norming” flies in the face of science (which is proving that men and women are even more ...",Social Science,,,15.02,EUR,15.02,EUR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YFL5DQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,1.0,listPrice,15020000.0,EUR,http://books.google.nl/books/download/Sex_Scandal-sample-epub.acsm?id=YFL5DQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,,,,

But now, as Roger Kimball reveals in this witty and provocative book, the student is less likely to learn about the aesthetics of masterworks than to be told, for instance, that Peter Paul Rubens' great painting Drunken Silenus is an allegory about anal rape. Or that Courbet's famous hunting pictures are psychodramas about ""castration anxiety."" Or that Gauguin's Manao tupapau is an example of the way repression is ""written on the bodies of women."" Or that Jan van Eyck's masterful Arnolfini Portrait is about ""middle-class deceptions ... and the treatment of women."" Or that Mark Rothko's abstract White Band (Number 27) ""parallels the pictorial structure of a pieta."" Or that Winslow Homer's The Gulf Stream is ""a visual encoding of racism."" In ""The Rape of the Masters: How Political Correctness Sabotages Art,"" Kimball, a noted art critic himself, shows how academic art history is increasingly held hostage to radical cultural politics--feminism, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, the whole armory of academic antihumanism. To make his point, he describes how eight famous works of art (reprinted here as illustrations) have been made over to fit a radical ideological fantasy. Kimball then performs a series of intellectual rescue operations, explaining how these great works should be understood through a series of illuminating readings in which art, not politics, guides the discussion. ""The Rape of the Masters"" exposes the charlatanry that fuels much academic art history and leaks into the art world generally, affecting galleries, museums and catalogues. It also provides an engaging antidote to the tendentious, politically motivated assaults on our treasured sources of culture and civilization.",ISBN_13,9781594031212,True,True,186.0,BOOK,NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.1.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3z45znso5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3z45znso5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N3z45znso5cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781594031212&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N3z45znso5cC&dq=isbn:9781594031212&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Rape_of_the_Masters.html?hl=&id=N3z45znso5cC,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,NL,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=N3z45znso5cC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"In this witty and provocative book, a noted art critic shows how academic art history is increasingly held hostage to radical cultural politics--feminism, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, and the whole armory of academic antihumanism ...",Art,3.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Rape_of_the_Masters-sample-epub.acsm?id=N3z45znso5cC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,,http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Rape_of_the_Masters-sample-pdf.acsm?id=N3z45znso5cC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,,

If the science is flawed, plainly the policies are too. Worldwide, billions of public money will be mis-spent, unnecessary costs placed on existing industry, new industrial development hampered. Together, these three authors are well-placed to point up the weaknesses in the scientific argument that global warming is a man-made phenomenon, and are able to analyse that murky place where the needs for recognition, research grants and votes all come together.

In the space of a year, it's gone from something that most Americans had never heard of to a cause claiming the mantle of civil rights. But can a boy truly be ""trapped"" in a girl's body? Can modern medicine really ""reassign"" sex? Is sex something ""assigned"" in the first place? What's the loving response to a friend or child experiencing a gender-identity conflict? What should our law say on these issues? When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment provides thoughtful answers to all of these questions. Drawing on the best insights from biology, psychology, and philosophy, Ryan T. Anderson offers a balanced approach to the policy issues, a nuanced vision of human embodiment, and a sober and honest survey of the human costs of getting human nature wrong. He reveals a grim contrast between the media's sunny depiction and the often sad realities of gender-identity struggles. He introduces readers to people who tried to ""transition"" but found themselves no better off. Especially troubling is the suffering felt by adults who were encouraged to transition as children but later came to regret it. And there is a reason that many do regret it. As Anderson shows, the most helpful therapies focus not on achieving the impossible--changing bodies to conform to thoughts and feelings--but on helping people accept and even embrace the truth about their bodies and reality. This discussion will be of particular interest to parents who fear how an ideological school counselor might try to steer their child. The best evidence shows that the vast majority of children naturally grow out of any gender-conflicted phase. But no one knows how new school policies might affect children indoctrinated to believe that they really are trapped in the ""wrong"" body. Throughout the book, Anderson highlights the various contradictions at the heart of this moment: How it embraces the gnostic idea that the real self is something other than the body, while also embracing the idea that nothing but the physical exists. How it relies on rigid sex stereotypes--in which dolls are for girls and trucks are for boys--while also insisting that gender is purely a social construct, and that there are no meaningful differences between women and men. How it assumes that feelings of identity deserve absolute respect, while the facts of our embodiment do not. How it preaches that people should be free to do as they please and define their own truth--while enforcing a ruthless campaign to coerce anyone who dares to dissent. Everyone has something at stake in today's debates about gender identity. Analyzing education and employment policies, Obama-era bathroom and locker-room mandates, politically correct speech codes and religious-freedom violations, Anderson shows how the law is being used to coerce and penalize those who believe the truth about human nature. And he shows how Americans can begin to push back with principle and prudence, compassion and grace.",ISBN_10,1594039615,False,False,,BOOK,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781594039614&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781594039614&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/When_Harry_Became_Sally.html?hl=&id=dS1cAQAACAAJ,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,NL,NO_PAGES,False,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dS1cAQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,NONE,False,"What should our law say on these issues?

Paltridge,Taylor Trade Publications,2010-06-16,"So you think the theory of disastrous climate change has been proven? You believe scientists are united in their efforts to affect a reduction in carbon emissions? You trust that scientists are far too professional to overstate their case? Maybe we should all think again. In The Climate Caper, written with a light touch and a readable manner, Garth Paltridge shows that the case for action against climate change is not nearly so clear cut after all. He leads us through the inherent problems of the climate modeling process, as well as the uncertainties associated with economic forecasts of climatic doom. Paltridge uncovers the conscious and subconscious forces that hide skepticism within the scientific community from the public eye and submit governments to a scientific and technological elite-an elite that achieves its ends by manipulating the public through fear of climate change, creating the world's greatest example of a religion for the politically correct.",ISBN_13,9781589795495,True,True,120.0,BOOK,NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.3.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,un,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781589795495&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&dq=isbn:9781589795495&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Climate_Caper.html?hl=&id=XYK_mrKg1V4C,NL,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,NL,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XYK_mrKg1V4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"Maybe we should all think again.
