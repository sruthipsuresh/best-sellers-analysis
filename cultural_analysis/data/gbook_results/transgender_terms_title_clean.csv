6,Transgender Rights,,Paisley Currah,"""Transgender Rights packs a surprising amount of information into a small space. Offering spare, tightly executed essays, this slim volume nonetheless succeeds in creating a spectacular, well-researched compendium of the transgender movement."" -Law Library Journal Over the past three decades, the transgender movement has gained visibility and achieved significant victories. Discrimination has been prohibited in several states, dozens of municipalities, and more than two hundred private companies, while hate crime laws in eight states have been amended to include gender identity. Yet prejudice and violence against transgender people remain all too common. With analysis from legal and policy experts, activists and advocates, Transgender Rights assesses the movement's achievements, challenges, and opportunities for future action. Examining crucial topics like family law, employment policies, public health, economics, and grassroots organizing, this groundbreaking book is an indispensable resource in the fight for the freedom and equality of those who cross gender boundaries. Moving beyond media representations to grapple with the real lives and issues of transgender people, Transgender Rights will launch a new moment for human rights activism in America.

10,The Singing Teacher's Guide to Transgender Voices,,Liz Jackson Hearns,"The Singing Teacher's Guide to Transgender Voices is the first comprehensive resource developed for training transgender and nonbinary singers. This text aids in the development of voice pedagogy tailored to the needs of transgender singers, informed by cultural competence, and bolstered by personal narratives of trans and nonbinary singing students. The singing life of a transgender or nonbinary student can be overwhelmingly stressful. Because many of the current systems in place for singing education are so firmly anchored in gender binary systems, transgender and gender nonconforming singers are often forced into groups with which they feel they don't belong. Singers in transition are often afraid to reach out for help because the likelihood of finding a voice teacher who is competent in navigating the social, emotional, physical, and physiological challenges of transition is minimal at best. This text equips teachers with a sympathetic perspective on these unique struggles and with the knowledge and resources needed to guide students to a healthy, joyful, and safe singing life. It challenges professional and academic communities to understand the needs of transgender singers and provide evidence-based voice education and real-world opportunities that are authentic and genuine. The Singing Teacher's Guide to Transgender Voices is the first book of its kind to provide thorough, organized information on the training of trans singers for educators in both the academic and independent teaching realms.","This text aids in the development of voice pedagogy tailored to the needs of transgender singers, informed by cultural competence, and bolstered by personal narratives of trans and nonbinary singing students.",9781635500943,
12,Imagining Transgender,An Ethnography of a Category,David Valentine,"Imagining Transgender is an ethnography of the emergence and institutionalization of transgender as a category of collective identity and political activism. Embraced by activists in the early 1990s to advocate for gender-variant people, the category quickly gained momentum in public health, social service, scholarly, and legislative contexts. Working as a safer-sex activist in Manhattan during the late 1990s, David Valentine conducted ethnographic research among mostly male-to-female transgender-identified people at drag balls, support groups, cross-dresser organizations, clinics, bars, and clubs. However, he found that many of those labeled ""transgender"" by activists did not know the term or resisted its use. Instead, they self-identified as ""gay,"" a category of sexual rather than gendered identity and one rejected in turn by the activists who claimed these subjects as transgender. Valentine analyzes the reasons for and potential consequences of this difference, and how social theory is implicated in it. Valentine argues that ""transgender"" has been adopted so rapidly in the contemporary United States because it clarifies a model of gender and sexuality that has been gaining traction within feminism, psychiatry, and mainstream gay and lesbian politics since the 1970s: a paradigm in which gender and sexuality are distinct arenas of human experience. This distinction and the identity categories based on it erase the experiences of some gender-variant people--particularly poor persons of color--who conceive of gender and sexuality in other terms. While recognizing the important advances transgender has facilitated, Valentine argues that a broad vision of social justice must include, simultaneously, an attentiveness to the politics of language and a recognition of how social theoretical models and broader political economies are embedded in the day-to-day politics of identity.","The book is sure to stir debate in the emerging field of transgender studies, as well as in other disciplines that concern themselves with this timely topic.&quot;--Susan Stryker, coeditor of &quot;The Transgender Studies Reader&quot;",9780822338697,Imagining Transgender An Ethnography of a Category

Offering multidisciplinary models for this assimilation, the vibrant essays in Transfeminist Perspectives in and beyond Transgender and Gender Studies suggest timely and necessary changes for institutions of higher learning.

Or what if your child uses a term you’ve never heard of to describe themselves (neutrois, agender, non-binary, genderqueer, androgyne…) and when you didn’t know what they meant, they left the room and now won’t speak to you about it?

36,Transgender Migrations,"The Bodies, Borders, and Politics of Transition",Trystan T. Cotten,"Transgender Migrations brings together a top-notch collection of emerging and established scholars to examine the way that the term ""migration"" can be used not only to look at the way trans bodies migrate from one gender to the (an?) other, but the way that trans people migrate in the larger geopolitical contexts of immigration reform, the war on terror, the war on drugs, and the increased policing of national borders. The book centers trans-ing experiences, identities, and politics, and treats these identities as inextricably intertwined with other social identities, institutions, and discourses of sexuality, nationality, race and ethnicity, globalization, colonialism, and terrorism. The chapter authors explore not only the movement of bodies in, through, and across spaces and borders, but also chart the metamorphoses of these bodies in relation to migration and mobility.

38,Sorted,"Growing Up, Coming Out, and Finding My Place (A Transgender Memoir)",Jackson Bird,"An unflinching and endearing memoir from LGBTQ+ advocate Jackson Bird about how, through a childhood of gender mishaps and an awkward adolescence, he finally sorted things out and came out as a transgender man in his mid-twenties. When Jackson Bird was twenty-five, he came out as transgender to his friends, family, and anyone in the world with an internet connection. Assigned female at birth and having been raised a girl, he often wondered if he should have been born a boy. Jackson didn’t share this thought with anyone because he didn’t think he could share it with anyone. Growing up in Texas in the 1990s, he had no transgender role models. He barely remembers meeting anyone who was openly gay, let alone being taught that transgender people existed outside of punchlines. Today, Jackson is a writer, YouTuber, and LGBTQ+ advocate living openly and happily as a transgender man. So how did he get here? In this remarkable, educational, and uplifting memoir, Jackson chronicles the ups and downs of growing up gender confused. Illuminated by journal entries spanning childhood to adolescence to today, he candidly recalls the challenges he faced while trying to sort out his gender and sexuality, and worrying about how to interact with the world. With warmth and wit, Jackson also recounts how he navigated the many obstacles and quirks of his transition––like figuring out how to have a chest binder delivered to his NYU dorm room and having an emotional breakdown at a Harry Potter fan convention. From his first shot of testosterone to his eventual top surgery, Jackson lets you in on every part of his journey—taking the time to explain trans terminology and little-known facts about gender and identity along the way. Through his captivating prose, Bird not only sheds light on the many facets of a transgender life, but also demonstrates the power and beauty in being yourself, even when you’re not sure who “yourself” is. Part memoir, part educational guide, Sorted is a frank, humorous narrative of growing up with some unintended baggage.","An unflinching and endearing memoir from LGBTQ+ advocate Jackson Bird about how, through a childhood of gender mishaps and an awkward adolescence, he finally sorted things out and came out as a transgender man in his mid-twenties.",9781982130756,"Sorted Growing Up, Coming Out, and Finding My Place (A Transgender Memoir)"
40,The Lives of Transgender People,,Brett Genny Beemyn,"Responding to a critical need for greater perspectives on transgender life in the United States, Genny Beemyn and Susan (Sue) Rankin apply their extensive expertise to a groundbreaking survey?one of the largest ever conducted in the U.S.?on gender development and identity-making among transsexual women, transsexual men, crossdressers, and genderqueer individuals. With nearly 3,500 participants, the survey is remarkably diverse, and with more than 400 follow-up interviews, the data offers limitless opportunities for research and interpretation. Beemyn and Rankin track the formation of gender identity across individuals and groups, beginning in childhood and marking the ""touchstones"" that led participants to identify as transgender. They explore when and how participants noted a feeling of difference because of their gender, the issues that caused them to feel uncertain about their gender identities, the factors that encouraged them to embrace a transgender identity, and the steps they have taken to meet other transgender individuals. Beemyn and Rankin's findings expose the kinds of discrimination and harassment experienced by participants in the U.S. and the psychological toll of living in secrecy and fear. They discover that despite increasing recognition by the public of transgender individuals and a growing rights movement, these populations continue to face bias, violence, and social and economic disenfranchisement. Grounded in empirical data yet rich with human testimony, The Lives of Transgender People adds uncommon depth to the literature on this subject and introduces fresh pathways for future research.","Grounded in empirical data yet rich with human testimony, The Lives of Transgender People adds uncommon depth to the literature on this subject and introduces fresh pathways for future research.",9780231143066,
42,Being Jazz,My Life as a (transgender) Teen,Jazz Jennings,"Jazz Jennings is one of the youngest and most prominent voices in the national discussion about gender identity. At the age of five, Jazz transitioned to life as a girl, with the support of her parents. A year later, her parents allowed her to share her incredible journey in her first Barbara Walters interview, aired at a time when the public was much less knowledgeable or accepting of the transgender community. This groundbreaking interview was followed over the years by other high-profile interviews, a documentary, the launch of her YouTube channel, a picture book, and her own reality TV series--I Am Jazz--making her one of the most recognizable activists for transgender teens, children, and adults. In her remarkable memoir, Jazz reflects on these very public experiences and how they have helped shape the mainstream attitude toward the transgender community. But it hasn't all been easy. Jazz has faced many challenges, bullying, discrimination, and rejection, yet she perseveres as she educates others about her life as a transgender teen. Through it all, her family has been beside her on this journey, standing together against those who don't understand the true meaning of tolerance and unconditional love. Now Jazz must learn to navigate the physical, social, and emotional upheavals of adolescence--particularly high school--complicated by the unique challenges of being a transgender teen.

46,Terrorizing Gender,Transgender Visibility and the Surveillance Practices of the U. S. Security State,Mia Fischer,"The increased visibility of transgender people in mainstream media, exemplified by Time magazine's declaration that 2014 marked a ""transgender tipping point,"" was widely believed to signal a civil rights breakthrough for trans communities in the United States. In Terrorizing Gender Mia Fischer challenges this narrative of progress, bringing together transgender, queer, critical race, legal, surveillance, and media studies to analyze the cases of Chelsea Manning, CeCe McDonald, and Monica Jones. Tracing how media and state actors collude in the violent disciplining of these trans women, Fischer exposes the traps of visibility by illustrating that dominant representations of trans people as deceptive, deviant, and threatening are integral to justifying, normalizing, and reinforcing the state-sanctioned violence enacted against them. The heightened visibility of transgender people, Fischer argues, has actually occasioned a conservative backlash characterized by the increased surveillance of trans people by the security state, evident in debates over bathroom access laws, the trans military ban, and the rescission of federal protections for transgender students and workers. Terrorizing Gender concludes that the current moment of trans visibility constitutes a contingent cultural and national belonging, given the gendered and racialized violence that the state continues to enact against trans communities, particularly those of color.","In Terrorizing Gender Mia Fischer challenges this narrative of progress, bringing together transgender, queer, critical race, legal, surveillance, and media studies to analyze the cases of Chelsea Manning, CeCe McDonald, and Monica Jones.",9781496218506,Terrorizing Gender Transgender Visibility and the Surveillance Practices of the U.

All Amanda Jetté Knox ever wanted was to enjoy a stable life. She never knew her biological father, and while her mother and stepfather were loving parents, the situation was sometimes chaotic. At school, she was bullied mercilessly, and at the age of fourteen, she entered a counselling program for alcohol addiction and was successful. While still a teenager, she met the love of her life. They were wed at 20, and the first of three children followed shortly. Jetté Knox finally had the stability she craved--or so it seemed. Their middle child struggled with depression and avoided school. The author was unprepared when the child she knew as her son came out as transgender at the age of eleven. Shocked, but knowing how important it was to support her daughter, Jetté Knox became an ardent advocate for trans rights. But the story wasn't over. For many years, the author had coped with her spouse's moodiness, but that chronic unhappiness was taking a toll on their marriage. A little over a year after their child came out, her partner also came out as transgender. Knowing better than most what would lie ahead, Jetté Knox searched for positive examples of marriages surviving transition. When she found no role models, she determined that her family would become one. The shift was challenging, but slowly the family members noticed that they were becoming happier and more united.

But what was it like to live as a transgender person in a media environment before this transgender boom in television?

Deeply rooted in the life stories of transgender people, the book uses everyday circumstances to show how media and technology operate as a medium through which transgender individuals are able to cultivate an understanding of their identities, build inhabitable worlds, and achieve the routine affordances of everyday life from which they are often excluded. Expertly researched and eloquently argued, Struggling for Ordinary sheds a fascinating new light of the everyday struggles of individuals and communities, to seek a life in which transgender identity is fully integrated into the ordinary.","Deeply rooted in the life stories of transgender people, the book uses everyday circumstances to show how media and technology operate as a medium through which transgender individuals are able to cultivate an understanding of their ...",9781479864584,Struggling for Ordinary Media and Transgender Belonging in Everyday Life
58,Sexual Orientation and Transgender Issues in Organizations,Global Perspectives on LGBT Workforce Diversity,Thomas Köllen,"Over the last decade workforce diversity has attracted much scientific attention. Given the shortage of literature on issues related to homosexual, bisexual and transgender employees, compared to other facets of workforce diversity, this book opens up new perspectives on this issue. Emphasis is placed on the equal consideration of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender issues. Thus the predominance of lesbian and gay issues in LGBT research (and practice), will be contrasted by an explicit consideration of the unique experiences, stressors and related needs of bisexual and transgender employees. Contributions provide deeper insights into the differing experiences the whole spectrum of LGBT employees make in the workplace in different national and occupational contexts. Furthermore, the collection offers contextualized insights for evaluating and conceptualizing organizational initiatives aiming at a higher level of inclusion for LGBT employees.","Given the shortage of literature on issues related to homosexual, bisexual and transgender employees, compared to other facets of workforce diversity, this book opens up new perspectives on this issue.",9783319296234,Sexual Orientation and Transgender Issues in Organizations Global Perspectives on LGBT Workforce Diversity
60,Transgender Athletes in Competitive Sport,,Eric Anderson,"While efforts to include gay and lesbian athletes in competitive sport have received significant attention, it is only recently that we have begun examining the experiences of transgender athletes in competitive sport. This book represents the first comprehensive study of the challenges that transgender athletes face in competitive sport; and the challenges they pose for this sex-segregated institution. Beginning with a discussion of the historical role that sport has played in preserving sex as a binary, the book examines how gender has been policed by policymakers within competitive athletics. It also considers how transgender athletes are treated by a system predicated on separating males from females, consequently forcing transgender athletes to negotiate the system in coercive ways. The book not only exposes our culture’s binary thinking in terms of both sex and gender, but also offers a series of thought-provoking and sometimes contradictory recommendations for how to make sport more hospitable, inclusive and equitable. Transgender Athletes in Competitive Sport is important reading for all students and scholars of the sociology of sport with an interest in the relationship between sport and gender, politics, identity and ethics.",This book represents the first comprehensive study of the challenges that transgender athletes face in competitive sport; and the challenges they pose for this sex-segregated institution.,9781315304250,
62,Transgender Rights,From Obama to Trump,Susan Gluck Mezey,"This book examines the transgender community’s struggle for equality over the last decade, comparing the Obama and Trump administrations’ stance on transgender rights policies. Transgender rights claims have assumed an important place on the nation’s policymaking agenda as society has increasingly become aware that transgender individuals are subject to discrimination because they do not conform to the norms of the gender identity they were assigned at birth. With Congress virtually absent from the policymaking process, the executive branch and the federal courts have been chiefly responsible for determining the parameters of transgender rights policies. The study contrasts the Obama administration’s efforts to expand equal rights for the transgender community, especially in employment, education, and military service, with the Trump administration’s determination to rescind the Obama-era initiatives. In their efforts to do so, Trump administration officials have urged the courts to reverse decisions extending the benefit of civil rights laws and constitutional guarantees to the transgender community, arguing that gender identity is outside the scope of these protections. Although most federal courts have been inclined to accept the Obama administration’s perspective on transgender rights, ultimately, this will be a matter for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide. The book is appropriate for students, scholars, and interested general readers.","This book examines the transgender community’s struggle for equality over the last decade, comparing the Obama and Trump administrations’ stance on transgender rights policies.",9781351120845,Transgender Rights From Obama to Trump

66,Trans* in College,Transgender Students' Strategies for Navigating Campus Life and the Institutional Politics of Inclusion,Z. Nicolazzo,"This is both a personal book that offers an account of the author's own trans* identity and a deeply engaged study of trans* collegians that reveals the complexities of trans* identities, and how these students navigate the trans* oppression present throughout society and their institutions, create community and resilience, and establish meaning and control in a world that assumes binary genders. This book is addressed as much to trans* students themselves - offering them a frame to understand the genders that mark them as different and to address the feelings brought on by the weight of that difference - as it is to faculty, student affairs professionals, and college administrators, opening up the implications for the classroom and the wider campus. This book not only remedies the paucity of literature on trans* college students, but does so from a perspective of resiliency and agency. Rather than situating trans* students as problems requiring accommodation, this book problematizes the college environment and frames trans* students as resilient individuals capable of participating in supportive communities and kinship networks, and of developing strategies to promote their own success. Z Nicolazzo provides the reader with a nuanced and illuminating review of the literature on gender and sexuality that sheds light on the multiplicity of potential expressions and outward representations of trans* identity as a prelude to the ethnography ze conducted with nine trans* collegians that richly documents their interactions with, and responses to, environments ranging from the unwittingly offensive to explicitly antagonistic. The book concludes by giving space to the study's participants to themselves share what they want college faculty, staff, and students to know about their lived experiences. Two appendices respectively provide a glossary of vocabulary and terms to address commonly asked questions, and a description of the study design, offered as guide for others considering working alongside marginalized population in a manner that foregrounds ethics, care, and reciprocity.",WINNER of 2017 AERA DIVISION J OUTSTANDING PUBLICATION AWARD CHOICE 2017 Outstanding Academic Title This is both a personal book that offers an account of the author&#39;s own trans* identity and a deeply engaged study of trans* collegians that ...,1620364565,Trans* in College Transgender Students' Strategies for Navigating Campus Life and the Institutional Politics of Inclusion
68,Unbound,Transgender Men and the Remaking of Identity,Arlene Stein,"An intimate portrait of a new generation of transmasculine individuals as they undergo gender transitions Award-winning sociologist Arlene Stein takes us into the lives of four strangers who find themselves together in a sun-drenched surgeon's office, having traveled to Florida from across the United States in order to masculinize their chests. Ben, Lucas, Parker, and Nadia wish to feel more comfortable in their bodies; three of them are also taking testosterone so that others recognize them as male. Following them over the course of a year, Stein shows how members of this young transgender generation, along with other gender dissidents, are refashioning their identities and challenging others' conceptions of who they are. During a time of conservative resurgence, they do so despite great personal costs. Transgender men comprise a large, growing proportion of the trans population, yet they remain largely invisible. In this powerful, timely, and eye-opening account, Stein draws from dozens of interviews with transgender people and their friends and families, as well as with activists and medical and psychological experts. Unbound documents the varied ways younger trans men see themselves and how they are changing our understanding of what it means to be male and female in America.",Unbound documents the varied ways younger trans men see themselves and how they are changing our understanding of what it means to be male and female in America.,9781101972496,Unbound Transgender Men and the Remaking of Identity

Girshick, a sociologist and social justice activist, brings together the voices of sex- and gender-diverse people who speak with absolute candor about their lives. Girshick presents transpeople speaking in their own voices about identity, coming out, passing, sexual orientation, relationship negotiations and the dynamics of attraction, homophobia (including internalized fears), and bullying. She exposes the guilt and the shame that ""gender police"" use in their attempts to exert control and points out the many ways transpeople are discriminated against in daily life, from filling out identification documents to gender-segregated bathrooms. By showing us a variety of descriptions of diverse real lives and providing a thorough exploration of the embodied experiences of gender variant people, Girshick demonstrates that there is nothing inherently binary about gender, and that the way each of us experiences our own gender is, in fact, normal and natural.","In this extraordinary book, based on 150 in-depth interviews, Lori B.

74,Transgender Psychoanalysis,A Lacanian Perspective on Sexual Difference,Patricia Gherovici,"Drawing on the author’s clinical work with gender-variant patients, Transgender Psychoanalysis: A Lacanian Perspective on Sexual Difference argues for a depathologizing of the transgender experience, while offering an original analysis of sexual difference. We are living in a ""trans"" moment that has become the next civil rights frontier. By unfixing our notions of gender, sex, and sexual identity, challenging normativity and essentialisms, trans modalities of embodiment can help reorient psychoanalytic practice. This book addresses sexual identity and sexuality by articulating new ideas on the complex relationship of the body to the psyche, the precariousness of gender, the instability of the male/female opposition, identity construction, uncertainties about sexual choice—in short, the conundrum of sexual difference. Transgender Psychoanalysis features explications of Lacanian psychoanalysis along with considerations on sex and gender in the form of clinical vignettes from Patricia Gherovici's practice as a psychoanalyst. The book engages with popular culture and psychoanalytic literature (including Jacques Lacan’s treatments of two transgender patients), and implements close readings uncovering a new ethics of sexual difference. These explorations have important implications not just for clinicians in psychoanalysis and mental health practitioners but also for transgender theorists and activists, transgender people, and professionals in the trans field. Transgender Psychoanalysis promises to enrich ongoing discourses on gender, sexuality, and identity.","This book addresses sexual identity and sexuality by articulating new ideas on the complex relationship of the body to the psyche, the precariousness of gender, the instability of the male/female opposition, identity construction, ...",9781317594178,Transgender Psychoanalysis A Lacanian Perspective on Sexual Difference

78,Third Wave Feminism and Transgender,Strength through Diversity,Edward BURLTON Davies,"Feminism and transgender, as social factions or collective subjectivities, have historically evaded, vilified or negated each other’s philosophy and subjectivities. In particular, separatist feminist theorists have portrayed the two ‘sides’ as consisting of mutually incompatible aims and subjectivities. These portrayals have worked to the detriment of both feminism and transgender. Third Wave Feminism and Transgender considers what positive outcomes on society in general, and the law as it pertains to gender in particular, may emerge from the identification of and cooperation between third wave feminism and transgender. Challenging the ‘internecine exclusion’ between and within each faction, Davies shows that queer-inspired philosophical third wave feminism promises to be an inclusive social discourse providing a substantial challenge to mutual exclusion. Indeed, this book explores the span of maternal relations, including womanism, ethics of care and semiotic language and subsequently reveals how gender variant people can highlight the gendered operation of conventional ethics. With a focus on Carol Gilligan and Julia Kristeva as key instigators of a philosophical third wave of feminism, this enlightening monograph will appeal to students and postdoctoral researchers interested in fields such as women’s studies, transgender studies and gender law.","Indeed, this book explores the span of maternal relations, including womanism, ethics of care and semiotic language and subsequently reveals how gender variant people can highlight the gendered operation of conventional ethics.",9781351608077,Third Wave Feminism and Transgender Strength through Diversity

86,Teaching With Racial Microaggressions in Mind: How to Recognize and Stop Using Racial Microaggressions in Your K-12 Classroom,,Joseph R. Gibson,"This book was written to promote those typically unfamiliar or unpracticed strategies that if normalized can help us best educate all K-12 students, regardless of race. Accordingly, as opposed to ""not seeing color"" or somehow ignoring race, the goal is to explore ways to reduce the impact of racism on Black students specifically. ""Racism is endemic to American life,"" noted Mari Matsuda et al., including those minimally diverse K-12 schools and classrooms with almost all or very few Black students. Many educators are becoming increasingly aware of the role of race in the classroom, but too few ever know how race is repeatedly a catalyst for their personal use of racial microaggressions. Consequently, racial microaggressions can and regularly do occur in any classroom, including yours, oftentimes unconsciously, always destructively.I write this fully conscious of the possibility of outright rejection or uninformed rationalization on the part of my target audience: any and all educators of Black students in America. There's also this idea, noted Anne Gregory, that ""if we name the phenomenon, it's teacher blaming"" even when it's not. Teacher or administrator blaming triggers denial and defensiveness, which is totally counterproductive if the goal is reflection and continuous improvement. My goal is to thoroughly inform, promote accountability, and hopefully inspire change, but certainly not just blame. While homicidal racial violence (e.g., filmed police killings of unarmed Black people) and other ""hate crimes receive the most attention,"" the greatest race-based damage ""to the life experiences of people of color is from racial microaggression."" These ""cumulative insults"" perpetuate feelings of inferiority and cause unnecessary, chronic (and brain-changing) ""stress to people of color while privileging whites."" Regrettably, the ""most detrimen¬tal forms of microaggressions can be delivered by well-intentioned individuals who are unaware that they have engaged in harmful conduct toward members of a socially devalued group.""Yet, when they are made aware of their behavior, most microaggressors tend to ""deny that they intended to offend, believe the person of color raising the issue is 'oversensitive, ' 'paranoid, ' or has simply misinterpreted the situation."" Even when acknowledging their unintentional (and usually habitual) use of microaggressions, offenders (oftentimes impulsively seeking self-defense) are more likely to trivialize, exceptionalize, or rationalize than adequately problematize it.Racial microaggressions are absolutely ""acts of racism,"" confirmed Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic, ""consciously or unconsciously perpetrated, welling up from the assumptions about racial matters most of us absorb from the cultural heritage in which we come of age in the United States.""Students of color frequently experience racial microaggressions in all kinds of school situations. Research shows that relative to other non-White students nationally, African-American students are more likely to experience them from their microaggression-ignorant teachers and school administrators than from their classmates. Accordingly, it is imperative for all educators (i.e., teachers and administrators) of Black students to intentionally develop our capacity to recognize and confront anti-Black racial microaggressions (i.e., become microaggression-informed) and to stop committing them ourselves. This book will help you do just that by focusing specifically on the unique causes, consequences, and anticatalysts of racial microaggressions being committed against African-American elementary and secondary students every day in classrooms and schools across this country.","Please check out more of our related titles at thePGI.org/global-press!This book was written to promote those typically unfamiliar or unpracticed strategies that if normalized can help us best educate all K-12 students, regardless of race.",0998064572,

92,Microaggressions and Philosophy,,Lauren Freeman,"This is the first book to offer a philosophical engagement with microaggressions. It aims to provide an intersectional analysis of microaggressions that cuts across multiple dimensions of oppression and marginalization, and to engage a variety of perspectives that have been sidelined within the discipline of philosophy. The volume gathers a diverse group of contributors: philosophers of color, philosophers with disabilities, philosophers of various nationalities and ethnicities, and philosophers of several gender identities. Their unique frames of analysis articulate both how the concept of microaggressions can be used to clarify and sharpen our understanding of subtler aspects of oppression and how analysis, expansion, and reconceiving the notion of a microaggression can deepen and extend its explanatory power. The essays in the volume seek to defend microaggressions from common critiques and to explain their impact beyond the context of college students. Some of the guiding questions that this volume explores include, but are not limited to, the following: Can microaggressions be established as a viable scientific concept? What roles do microaggressions play in other oppressive phenomena like transphobia, fat phobia, and abelism? How can epistemological challenges around microaggressions be addressed via feminist theory, critical race theory, disability theory, or epistemologies of ignorance? What insights can be gleaned from intersectional analyses of microaggressions? Are there domain-specific analyses of microaggressions that would give insight to features of that domain, i.e. microaggressions related to sexuality, athletics, immigration status, national origin, body type, or ability. Microaggressions and Philosophyfeatures cutting-edge research on an important topic that will appeal to a wide range of students and scholars across disciplines. It includes perspectives from philosophy of psychology, empirically informed philosophy, feminist philosophy, critical race theory, disability theory, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, and social and political philosophy.",The essays in the volume are divided into four thematic parts.

Racial microaggressions are layered and cumulative assaults, often carried out in subtle and unconscious ways, which take a psychological and physiological toll on the body, mind, and spirit. The authors make a unique contribution to the study of racial microaggressions by using Critical Race Theory (CRT) to develop the concepts, frameworks, and models provided in this book.

96,"Microaggressions and Social Work Research, Practice and Education",,Michael S. Spencer,"While blatant forms of racism and discrimination have largely been condemned in our society, systematic oppression and racism can be manifested in a less obvious form, as ‘microaggressions’. The term, originally developed in the 1970s by Chester Peirce to describe the ways in which Black people were ""put down"" by their White counterparts, has since been expanded to describe both conscious and unconscious acts that reflect superiority, hostility, and racially inflicted insults and demeanors to marginalized groups of people. This book provides a platform for social work researchers, scholars, and practitioners to present their research, ideas, and practices pertaining to ways in which microaggressions and other subtle, but lethal forms of discrimination impact marginalized populations within social work and human services.

Sanders,"Carlosa third-generation U.S. citizen from New Jersey whose family emigrated from Colombia many years before Carlos was bornis often complimented on how articulate he is and asked how long he has been in the United States. Deborah, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) who is up for election as church treasurer, has her qualifications questioned, debated, and scrutinized by the congregation far more than any of her male predecessors who were elected with a simple vote. Lisa, a male-to-female transgender person, attends a Sunday school where her classmates continue to refer to her with masculine pronouns (he, him, his). The three examples above portray microaggressions: subtle slights, insults, and indignities expressed to persons of varied minority statuses. Although microaggressions are usually unintentional, they occur on a regular basis in education, the workplace, and daily life. This is the first book that addresses the concept of microaggressions in ministry and church life. Drawing from their background as ordained clergy, Sanders and Yarber introduce ministry leaders to the concept of microaggressions and look specifically at microaggressions directed at race, gender, and sexuality in the church. Sanders and Yarber help readers become more aware of these subtle and often unconscious communications, offering realistic examples and guidance for grappling with this issue in preaching, religious education, worship, spirituality, and pastoral care and counseling. Microaggressions in Ministry equips congregations with methods for assessment and tools for action that will ultimately help create stronger, more welcoming faith communities.","Although microaggressions are usually unintentional, they occur on a regular basis in education, the workplace, and daily life.

102,Microaggressions and Philosophy,,Lauren Freeman,"This is the first book to offer a philosophical engagement with microaggressions. It aims to provide an intersectional analysis of microaggressions that cuts across multiple dimensions of oppression and marginalization, and to engage a variety of perspectives that have been sidelined within the discipline of philosophy. The volume gathers a diverse group of contributors: philosophers of color, philosophers with disabilities, philosophers of various nationalities and ethnicities, and philosophers of several gender identities. Their unique frames of analysis articulate both how the concept of microaggressions can be used to clarify and sharpen our understanding of subtler aspects of oppression and how analysis, expansion, and reconceiving the notion of a microaggression can deepen and extend its explanatory power. The essays in the volume seek to defend microaggressions from common critiques and to explain their impact beyond the context of college students. Some of the guiding questions that this volume explores include, but are not limited to, the following: Can microaggressions be established as a viable scientific concept? What roles do microaggressions play in other oppressive phenomena like transphobia, fat phobia, and abelism? How can epistemological challenges around microaggressions be addressed via feminist theory, critical race theory, disability theory, or epistemologies of ignorance? What insights can be gleaned from intersectional analyses of microaggressions? Are there domain-specific analyses of microaggressions that would give insight to features of that domain, i.e. microaggressions related to sexuality, athletics, immigration status, national origin, body type, or ability. Microaggressions and Philosophy features cutting-edge research on an important topic that will appeal to a wide range of students and scholars across disciplines. It includes perspectives from philosophy of psychology, empirically informed philosophy, feminist philosophy, critical race theory, disability theory, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, and social and political philosophy.",This is the first book to offer a philosophical engagement with microaggressions.,9780429663611,

The authors—noted experts on the topic—explore the psychological effects of microaggressions on both perpetrators and targets. Subtle racism, sexism, and heterosexism remain relatively invisible and potentially harmful to the wellbeing, self-esteem, and standard of living of many marginalized groups in society. The book examines the manifestations of various forms of microaggressions and explores their impact. The text covers: researching microaggressions, exploring microaggressions in education, identifying best practices teaching about microaggressions, understanding microaggressions in the counseling setting, as well as guidelines for combating microaggressions.

These are not the familiar clashes between liberals and conservatives or the religious and the secular: instead, they are clashes between a new moral culture—victimhood culture—and a more traditional culture of dignity. Even as students increasingly demand trigger warnings and “safe spaces,” many young people are quick to police the words and deeds of others, who in turn claim that political correctness has run amok. Interestingly, members of both camps often consider themselves victims of the other. In tracking the rise of victimhood culture, Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning help to decode an often dizzying cultural milieu, from campus riots over conservative speakers and debates around free speech to the election of Donald Trump.","These are not the familiar clashes between liberals and conservatives or the religious and the secular: instead, they are clashes between a new moral culture—victimhood culture—and a more traditional culture of dignity.",9783319703299,"The Rise of Victimhood Culture Microaggressions, Safe Spaces, and the New Culture Wars"

Black students from a predominantly White institution in the Northeast were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format to explore the following research questions: (a) what is the experience of Black students with racial microaggressions in academic settings? (b) How do Black students navigate instances of racial microaggressions in academic settings? (c) How does the experience of racial microaggressions impact educational motivation and performance? Results included several themes including being perceived as an aggressor or criminal, under or over representation, normalizing, presumptions/stereotyping, despondent, fear of retaliation disconfirmation, and self-doubt. Black students associated their racial microaggressive experience with being Black and having a different racial background then their aggressors. Each theme was broken down and discussed further in this paper. The findings provide insight towards the need to bring awareness to academic institutions and policy makers, encourage the implementation of additional support in academic settings for Black students, as well as information to better inform mental health counselors and psychologists working with this population.",ABSTRACT: The current study was designed to explore the experiences of Black and or African American identified student&#39;s experiences with instances of racial microaggressions in academic settings.,OCLC:1192543495,Racial Microaggressions in Academia: Black Students’ Perspective A Dissertation Presented to the Faculty of Springfield College in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy

All therapists want and intend to be helpful to their clients, but many unknowingly committing microaggressions due to unconscious biases and misconceptions about people from ethnic and racial minority groups. Managing Microaggressions is intended for mental health clinicians who want to be more effective in their use of evidence-based practices with people of color. Many well-intentioned clinicians lack the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively engage those who are ethnoracially different.

Drawing on authors' experiences and empirical analyses, the volume puts forward practical recommendations to remedy such violence and tackle its root causes. Global Perspectives on Microaggressions in Schools brings together contributions from South Africa, Australia, Canada, and the US to explore the various forms that microaggression can take. Authors implement qualitative methodologies, personal reflection, and empirical literature to document microaggressions perpetrated by, and directed against all members of the school community, including students, teachers, school leaders and administrators. In doing so, they highlight ongoing issues including xenophobia, sexual violence, and prejudice against gifted students, LGBTQ, refugee, and indigenous communities. Looking forward, the volume proposes practical ways to undermine such prejudices and prevent the occurrence of microaggressions through effective training, policy, leadership, and student agency. Given its rigorous approach and attention to widespread issues of school violence, this book will be a timely resource for scholars, researchers, and academics with an interest in the sociology of education, educational leadership, school culture, student well-being, and inclusive education. In addition, school leaders, administrators, pre- and in-service educators may find benefit from reading this volume.","Recognizing microaggression as an often unseen, yet pervasive issue in schools globally, this book offers critical examination of instances of aggression, hostility, and incivility in school contexts around the world.",036754556X,Global Perspectives on Microaggressions in Schools Understanding and Combating Covert Violence
124,Racial Socialization and Its Moderating Effecrts on Microaggressions,,Jusiah L. Powell,"The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between racial socialization, and how it mitigates the distress caused by microaggressions. Although overt racism is no longer socially acceptable, racism still occurs in a covert form called microaggressions. Research has shown that microaggressions causes negative effects on its’ victims the same as overt racism. Also, literature has shown microaggressions in the classroom and on college campuses cause feelings of isolation and inferiority in college students. Racial socialization is the process of being immersed in one’s culture to strengthen against negative factors. The construct of racial socialization is the idea of creating cultural defenses against discrimination and racism. The target population of this study was African American students at Abilene Christian University. Participants took the Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions scale to assess their level of perceived microaggression. The Teenager Experience of Racial Socialization scale assessed their level of racial socialization. Finally, the participants took the Kessler 10 distress scale, which assessed their level of distress. The participant took the surveys through Surveymonkey. The data was analyzed using correlational methods. The results showed the frequencies of microaggressions that occurred. The top three microaggressions from each subscale were displayed. Also, the results showed no correlation between microaggressions and distress. As well as, a positive relationship between racial socialization and distress. These findings were counter to expectation. The relationship between racial socialization and microaggressions must be further examined to better understand the factors that create a positive relationship. The examination of the role perceptions of microaggressions plays in its’ effect on the victim should be examined in further studies.","The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between racial socialization, and how it mitigates the distress caused by microaggressions.",OCLC:989736572,
125,The Effects of Microaggressions on Self-efficacy in the Workplace Among Latinos,,Manuel Paul Leiva (Jr.),"This study analyzed the relationship between experienced racial microaggressions, their effects on the self-efficacy of Latinos, and how workplace racism might have increased the negative effects of the racial microaggressions. For this study, 102 students from a Southern California university were surveyed and a Multiple Regression statistical equation was used to analyze the data. The researcher hypothesized that the experience of racial microaggressions would be negatively correlated with a person's self-efficacy and that the experience of racism at work would increase the predictability of low self-efficacy due to microaggressions. However, the results indicated a much different outcome. It was found that there was no relationship between the experience of racial microaggressions and self-efficacy and that the experience of racism at work had no significant change on that relationship. This is not to infer that Latinos do not experience racism and its negative effects. Instead, it might suggest that the interplay between microaggressions, self-efficacy, and work experience may be more complex than previously thought.","This is not to infer that Latinos do not experience racism and its negative effects.

Anderson,"Despite significant increases in academic degrees earned in recent decades, underrepresentation in the sciences still remains for women, African-Americans, Latina/os, and Native Americans (National Science Foundation, 2015). According to social cognitive career theory, academic and career development is impacted by contextual factors, such as environmental barriers (Lent, Brown, and Hackett, 1994). Among previously examined factors, discrimination has been shown to be a barrier for individuals throughout their science academic and career development (Lent, Brown, and Hackett, 2000). However, the impact of microaggressions, a subtler form of discrimination, requires further exploration for its potential influence on underrepresented groups in the sciences. To fill the gap within the literature, the current study explored the role of racial and gender microaggressions on science academic and career choices. This study explored the racial and gender microaggressions that prevent diverse representation in the sciences, from the perspectives of youth, graduate students, and faculty who participate in a science support program for Latina/o youth. Three research questions were explored in this study: a) what are the perceived gender and racial/ethnic microaggressions in the sciences? b) what role do gender and racial microaggressions play in science education and careers? c) how do these perceptions of microaggressions vary by race/ethnicity, gender, and age? Qualitative one-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 youth, 11 graduate students, and 13 faculty members. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach (Charmaz, 2006) and prior taxonomies of microaggressions were used to inform analysis (Sue and others, 2007; Capodilupo and others, 2010). Perceptions of microaggressions fell into four overarching themes: 1) microinsults (including ascriptions of intelligence, assumptions of inferiority), 2) microinvalidations (including invisibility, denial of racism and sexism, restrictive gender roles), 3) gendered microassaults (including hiring discrimination, sexual harassment), and 4) environmental invalidations (including lack of women scientists, lack of scientists of color, lack of role models). Participants reported several ways in which microaggressions impacted their science education career development, including: 1) detrimental to psychological well-being, 2) mobility across science contexts, 3) pressure to prove ability and competence, and 4) sense of social isolation. As suggested by SCCT, these findings support the role of microaggressions as a contextual factor negatively influencing career development. The current study has implications for increasing well-being, retention, and participation of women and underrepresented ethnic/racial groups in the sciences.","Despite significant increases in academic degrees earned in recent decades, underrepresentation in the sciences still remains for women, African-Americans, Latina/os, and Native Americans (National Science Foundation, 2015).",OCLC:1028578820,"""It Just Weighs in the Back of Your Mind"" Microaggressions in Science"
129,School Connectedness as a Moderator Between Racial Microaggressions and Academic Performance for African American High School Students,,Courtney J. Wilson,"Racial microaggressions are subtle, often unconscious, words or actions that demean African Americans (Sue et al., 2007). The impact of racial microaggressions may not be seen, and so it is important to study potential long-term consequences such as academic performance. This study addressed an identified gap in the literature on the relationship between racial microaggressions and academic performance among African American high school students. A quantitative design was used to study the relationship between racial microaggressions and academic performance, and school connectedness as a moderating variable of this relationship. There were 417 high school students who completed the surveys. Of those students, 81 were used for the data analysis in this study because they identified as African American or Black. Results indicated that experience of racial microaggressions (from peers or from school staff) did not correlate with academic performance (GPA). Additionally, school connectedness was not found to moderate this relationship. Female students indicated more experiences with racial microaggressions than male students. Also, school connectedness was correlated with racial microaggressions such that the more racial microaggressions that students reported, the less connected they felt to the school. Furthermore, perceived racial microaggressions by school personnel were correlated with microaggressions by peers, indicating the more experiences students had of microaggressions by adults, the more they had by their peers. These results illustrated the importance of understanding students’ experiences and their environment in the school setting. Counseling implications and areas for future research are addressed and discussed.","Racial microaggressions are subtle, often unconscious, words or actions that demean African Americans (Sue et al., 2007).",OCLC:1037016359,

This qualitative study examined previously unexplored area of ethnic-racial microaggressions directed against Mexican-American persons. Through the use of a semi-structured focus group interview, 15 self-identifying Mexican-American university students shared their experiences of microaggressions. Data was collected and analyzed following the guidelines of Consensual Qualitative Research (Hill, Thompson & Williams, 1997), a rigorous method for analyzing qualitative data that involves a team approach in the development and coding of domains and core ideas in order to accurately describe consistencies across cases. Results identified 7 major domains of microaggressions experienced by participants: 1) Assumption of foreigner status, 2) Assumption of criminality, 3) Assumption of inferior social class and/or second class citizenship, 4) Pathologizing cultural values, 5) Invalidation of racial reality, 6) Implied special privileges as a minority group, and 7) Invalidation of interethnic differences. Two additional domains described participant0́9s emotional experiences of racial microaggressions and strategies employed by participants to cope with aggressive events. Results supported broad domains of racial microaggressions previously identified by other research teams in their research of Black American (Constantine, 2007; Sue, Nadal et al. 2008) and Asian-American (Sue, Bucceri, et al., 2007) experiences of racial microaggressions. Group-specific messages of racial microaggressions identified within this study include the assumption of illegal immigrant, messages regarding inferior English language skills, and messages pathologizing Mexican-American cultural values and forms of communication, particularly related to the Spanish language and traditional Mexican cultural values of familismo. This evidence supports the hypothesis first proposed by Sue, Capodilupo et al. (2007) that different racial and ethnic groups are vulnerable to experiencing different forms of racial microaggressions.","Racial microaggressions are the brief, commonplace racial slights and insults that are expressed by Whites against people of color (Sue, Capodilupo et al, 2007).",OCLC:841163353,

The study identifies the types of microaggressions experienced, reactions to these, coping mechanisms developed, and the effects microaggressions have on the participant's identity. Intersectional and multi-racial feminist frameworks are utilized to provide an analysis. By means of in-depth, one-on-one, semi-structured interviews, three forms of microaggressions were uncovered: environmental microaggressions, microinsults, and microinvalidations. Through these microaggressions, discriminatory ideologies that negate and invalidate the lived experiences of these Chicana participants are reproduced at an interpersonal level.

136,"Impact, Mechanisms, and Individual Variations in the Stress Response to Racial Microaggressions Among Asian Americans",,Gloria Wong-Padoongpatt,"People of Color (POC) experience racial microaggressions as racism-related slights and invalidations (D.W. Sue, 2009) perpetrated by the racially privileged (White Americans). POC report racial microaggressions as the most commonly experienced form of racial discrimination (D.W. Sue, 2010a). Race theorists claim that the racial nature of microaggressions marginalizes POC leading to stress (D.W. Sue, 2010a). Researchers are interested in examining the negative impact of racial microaggressions on psychological and physical health, yet only a few studies have uncovered the mechanisms by which these incidents affect mental and physical well-being. Furthermore, researchers are only beginning to explore whether certain personality traits exacerbate the stressful effect of racial microaggressions. The current study conceptualized racial microaggressions as a stressor and used the transactional model of stress (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) to address the major gaps in research. Consequently, this study 1) experimentally tested the racial nature of the microaggression event to determine whether a White perpetrator would elicit more stress compared to an Asian American perpetrator, 2) examined threats to self-concept as possible mediators of the microaggression-generated stress, and 3) investigated individual differences in anger tendency and sensitivity to rejection as moderators of the racial microaggression effect. Findings indicated that race of the perpetrator had an impact on stress in that a White perpetrator elicited more stress compared to an Asian American perpetrator. In the meditation analyses, experience with a White perpetrator, compared to an Asian American perpetrator, lowered implicit self-esteem, which resulted in more stress. Lastly, a three-way interaction between gender, perpetrator race, and rejection sensitivity was found. Implications for the well-being of marginalized individuals and intergroup interactions across social hierarchies are discussed.","People of Color (POC) experience racial microaggressions as racism-related slights and invalidations (D.W.

139,Racial Microaggressions and Its Impact on Supervisees of Color in Cross-racial Counseling Supervision,,Niyatee Sukumaran,"Supervision is considered to be a primary method of clinical instruction (Holloway, 1992), which serves as a foundation to train supervisees and to ensure the provision of appropriate and culturally sensitive client care. While the representation of supervisees of color in the field of psychology is continuing to increase, it appears important to recognize multicultural issues (e.g., racial microaggressions) as it exists and/or emerges in cross-racial supervision. Although less is known about how racial microaggressions influence supervisees of color, the purpose of this study was to investigate how experiences of racial microaggressions affects the supervisory working alliance, their perceptions of their supervisors’ multicultural competence, and supervisee outcome variables (i.e., counseling and multicultural counseling self-efficacy) in cross-racial supervision. The results showed that perceived supervisor multicultural competence partially mediated the relationship between racial microaggressions and supervisory working alliance. Both, supervisory working alliance and perceived supervisor multicultural competence fully mediated the relationship between racial microaggressions and multicultural counseling self-efficacy. However, no support for the mediation was found in this sample for counseling self-efficacy. Limitation, implications and future directions are discussed.","Supervision is considered to be a primary method of clinical instruction (Holloway, 1992), which serves as a foundation to train supervisees and to ensure the provision of appropriate and culturally sensitive client care.",OCLC:957157625,
140,African Americans and Racial Microaggressions,"Coping, Psychological Well-being, and Physical Health",,"The present study investigated microaggressions experienced by African Americans, the correlation to psychological and physical health outcomes for those who report microaggressions, and coping as potential buffer to the effects of these events. A correlational analysis and multiple regression analysis examined these relationships for a sample of 268 African American men and women. The results indicated support for the theory on the deleterious effects of microaggressions with the relationship between microaggressions and outcomes for psychological and physical health among African Americans. The study contributes to the literature on microaggressions by providing evidence that these encounters are harmful to African Americans. However, the moderation model did not support coping as a buffer to the effects of racial microaggressions, and it is suggested that future research investigate factors that will effectively mitigate the injurious effects of microaggressions.","The present study investigated microaggressions experienced by African Americans, the correlation to psychological and physical health outcomes for those who report microaggressions, and coping as potential buffer to the effects of these ...",OCLC:929921347,"African Americans and Racial Microaggressions Coping, Psychological Well-being, and Physical Health"
141,Racial Microaggressions in Everyday Work Life of Black Special Educators in PK-12 Schools,,Mishka-Sheree Yaneke Walker-Anderson,"The racialized job experiences of Black special educators are often not the dominant narrative when explaining their underrepresentation in the field of special education. Currently, African American teachers make up only 8.5% of the special education teaching staff in U.S. public schools, while African American students comprise 18.5% of students with disabilities served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Scholars have not focused on the quotidian racial microaggressions that African American prekindergarten through Grade 12 (PK-12) special educators encounter and the impact on their work, recruitment, retention, and underrepresentation. Research has suggested hiring and retaining African American special educators may improve African American student outcomes, by reducing special education disproportionality, high school dropout rates, academic underachievement, underemployment, and incarceration and by improving school performance and graduation rates. This dissertation was a case study in a northeastern major metropolitan city and suburb of 13 Black special educators' experiences with racial microaggressions, using a framework and methodology of dis/ability critical race studies and Afro pessimism. Three research questions guided this dissertation: What are the racial microaggressions African American special educators report they encounter at their PK-12 schools? How do racial microaggressions affect African American special educators' classroom teaching, job performance, job satisfaction, and retention? How do African American special educators cope with racial microaggressions at their workplace? Individual interviews indicated all of the Black special educators endured racial microaggressions, and most experienced a coupling of racism and ableism. The study provides evidence that racial and disability microaggressions are a constant occurrence in the work life of Black special educators",The study provides evidence that racial and disability microaggressions are a constant occurrence in the work life of Black special educators,OCLC:1246321570,
142,Black Female Graduate Students' Experiences of Racial Microaggressions at a Southern University,,Kendra Elizabeth Shoge,"Researchers have found that microaggressions can cause psychological distress, frustration, avoidance, confusion, resentment, hopelessness, and fear. Previous studies from Southern universities have addressed the adjustment experiences of Black women in graduate programs, obstacles faced by Black women in higher education and strategies to overcome those obstacles, and factors associated with Black student motivation and achievement. Discrimination and racism are factors identified in those studies, however, there is little research on the experiences of Black women in graduate programs and the impact of racial microaggressions on them. The purpose of this study was to examine Black female graduate students' experiences of racial microaggressions at a Southern university. Five women participated in the study, and a phenomenological research design was used to identify individual and group themes. These themes revealed the impact of racial microaggressions on the participants, as well as the campus climate.

227,Transgender Rights,From Obama to Trump,Susan Gluck Mezey,"This book examines the transgender community's struggle for equality over the last decade, comparing the Obama and Trump administrations' stance on transgender rights policies. Transgender rights claims have assumed an important place on the nation's policymaking agenda as society has increasingly become aware that transgender individuals are subject to discrimination because they do not conform to the norms of the gender identity they were assigned at birth. With Congress virtually absent from the policymaking process, the executive branch and the federal courts have been chiefly responsible for determining the parameters of transgender rights policies. The study contrasts the Obama administration's efforts to expand equal rights for the transgender community, especially in employment, education, and military service, with the Trump administration's determination to rescind the Obama-era initiatives. In their efforts to do so, Trump administration officials have urged the courts to reverse decisions extending the benefit of civil rights laws and constitutional guarantees to the transgender community, arguing that gender identity is outside the scope of these protections. Although most federal courts have seem inclined to accept the Obama administration's perspective on transgender rights, ultimately, this will be a matter for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide. The book is appropriate for students, scholars, and interested general readers.","This book examines the transgender community&#39;s struggle for equality over the last decade, comparing the Obama and Trump administrations&#39; stance on transgender rights policies.",081535939X,Transgender Rights From Obama to Trump
229,The Remarkable Rise of Transgender Rights,,Jami K. Taylor,"While medical identification and treatment of gender dysphoria have existed for decades, the development of transgender as a “collective political identity” is a recent construct. Over the past twenty-five years, the transgender movement has gained statutory nondiscrimination protections at the state and local levels, hate crimes protections in a number of states, inclusion in a federal law against hate crimes, legal victories in the courts, and increasingly favorable policies in bureaucracies at all levels. It has achieved these victories despite the relatively small number of trans people and despite the widespread discrimination, poverty, and violence experienced by many in the transgender community. This is a remarkable achievement in a political system where public policy often favors those with important resources that the transgender community lacks: access, money, and voters. The Remarkable Rise of Transgender Rights explains the growth of the transgender rights movement despite its marginalized status within the current political opportunity structure.","This is a remarkable achievement in a political system where public policy often favors those with important resources that the transgender community lacks: access, money, and voters.",9780472124275,

237,Organizing for Transgender Rights,"Collective Action, Group Development, and the Rise of a New Social Movement",Anthony J. Nownes,"Illuminates transgender activists' successful strategies to organize for social and political change in the US. In recent years, gender-variant people—including those we now call transgender people—have won public policy victories that had previously seemed unwinnable: the American Psychiatric Association replaced the term “gender identity disorder” with “gender dysphoria” in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Department of Justice announced that discrimination on the basis of gender identity constituted sex discrimination, and the Department of Health and Human Services decided that it would no longer stop Medicare from covering gender reassignment surgery. What accounts for these and other victories? Anthony J. Nownes argues that a large part of the answer lies in the rise of transgender rights interest groups in the United States. Drawing on firsthand accounts from the founders and leaders of these groups, Organizing for Transgender Rights not only addresses how these groups mobilized and survived but also illuminates a path to further social change. Nownes shows how oppressed and marginalized people can overcome the barriers to collective action and form viable organizations to represent their interests even when their government continues to be hostile and does not. Anthony J. Nownes is Professor of Political Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is the author of Interest Groups in American Politics: Pressure and Power, Second Edition and Total Lobbying: What Lobbyists Want (and How They Try to Get It).",What accounts for these and other victories?

239,Transforming Prejudice,"Identity, Fear, and Transgender Rights",Melissa R. Michelson,"Since the mid-1990s, there has been a seismic shift in attitudes toward gay and lesbian people, with a majority of Americans now supporting same-sex marriage and relations between same-sex, consenting adults. However, support for transgender individuals lags far behind; a significant majority of Americans do not support the right of transgender people to be free from discrimination in housing, employment, public spaces, health care, legal documents, and other areas. Much of this is due to deeply entrenched ideas about the definition of gender, perceptions that transgender people are not ""real"" or are suffering from mental illness, and fears that extending rights to transgender people will come at the expense of the rights of others. So how do you get people to rethink their prejudices? In this book, Melissa R. Michelson and Brian F. Harrison examine what tactics are effective in changing public opinion regarding transgender people. The result is a new approach that they call Identity Reassurance Theory. The idea is that individuals need to feel confident in their own identity before they can embrace a stigmatized group like transgender people, and that support of members of an outgroup can be encouraged by affirming the self-esteem of those targeted for attitude change. Michelson and Harrison, through their experiments, show that the most effective messaging on transgender issues meets people where they are, acknowledges their discomfort without judgment or criticism, and helps them to think about transgender people and rights in a way that aligns with their view of themselves as moral human beings.","So how do you get people to rethink their prejudices?

We were not on TV or in movies. What formed the visible part of the transcommunity – overwhelmingly white, urban, and middle class – was also overwhelmingly focused on conferences, surgery or hormones and cisgender acceptance. This was still a determinedly non-political population, often in defensive crouch because it was also constantly under attack by the media, police, local legislatures, feminists and even LGB-but-never-T advocates. We were a group that still thought of ourselves as a collection of separate individuals, not a movement. What made political consciousness so difficult was that there was no “transgender section” of town, where we saw each other regularly. And mainstream society mostly ignored us. And when it didn’t, it usually made clear it despised us. We were freaks. We were gendertrash. We lived in a transient and indoor community that knew itself only a few days at a time during conferences at hotels out on the interstate. But all that was about to change. Even when politics are avoided, bringing despised and marginalized people together is itself a political act. Without realizing or intending it, the community was reaching critical mass.

Excerpt: Transsexual people are those who establish a permanent identity with the gender opposite to the gender identified at birth. As most legal jurisdictions have at least some recognition of the two traditional genders at the exclusion of other categories, this raises many legal issues and aspects of transsexualism. Most of these issues tend to be located in what is generally considered family law, especially the issue of marriage, but also things such as the ability of a transgendered person to benefit from a partner's insurance or social security. The degree of legal recognition provided to transsexualism varies widely throughout the world. Many countries now extend legal recognition to sex reassignment by permitting a change of gender on the birth certificate. Many transsexual people have their bodies permanently changed by surgical means or semi-permanently changed by hormonal means (see Sex reassignment therapy). In many countries, some of these modifications are required for legal recognition. In a few, the legal aspects are directly tied to health care; i.e. the same bodies or doctors decide whether a person can go ahead, and the...",Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.,1230657312,"Transgender Rights Transgender Law, Legal Aspects of Transsexualism, Name Change, Legal Aspects of Transsexualism in the United States, Gender Recogn"

Taking into consideration the general public’s perspective, Gossip Boys & Girls series were written in the language for the wider population. Gossip in Chinese is 是非. It also means Right and Wrong. Gender and sexuality of a person could always be the focus in gossips among people no matter you are LGBT people or not. What even worst is that transgender people are always judged by the others as “right or wrong”. Two of my best transgender friends were unable to bear the suppression and committed suicide one in 2004, and another one in 2008. Another gay friend of mine has committed suicide recently in Jan 2017. What caused them to make such a decision? Is it their fault being true to themselves? I hope this handbook laid out from the experience of a transgender person who has overcame those unspeakable difficulties in life will give you more insight about the transgender community in Hong Kong.",This is a handbook consolidated and translated from three of our Chinese booklets Gossip Boys &amp; Girls series.,,The Book of Transgender in Hong Kong Gossip Boys & Girls Book 4
287,Transgender. A Marginalized and Stigmatized Community,,Mansoor Ahmad,"Document from the year 2018 in the subject Sociology - Gender Studies, grade: A, The University of Kashmir (Department of Sociology), course: PhD, language: English, abstract: Down the ages, our society has condemned and alienated people who do not conform to its norms. Transgender persons are one such group of people who have been marginalized, abused, disdained and callously neglected community in almost every known society. The term ―transgender is generally used to describe those who transgress social gender norms. Transgender is often used as an umbrella term to signify individuals who defy rigid, binary gender constructions and who expresses or present a breaking and blurring of culturally prevalent stereotypically gender roles. It includes pre-operative, post-operative and non- operative transsexual people who strongly identify with gender opposite to their biological sex. Transgender are known locally ‘laanch’ in Kashmir. They face discrimination in every aspect of life be it employment, legal recognition, access to social resources including decent life standard and education. As in other parts of the country, the third gender in Kashmir exists, but their existence is hardly recognized by the society and they are pushed to the boundaries. Though the J&K government has set up a committee to monitor and examine the formulation of various welfare policies on transgenders, a lot needs to be done. This study intended to expose sufferings, discrimination and marginalization of transgender; these persons are usually rejected from their families and other social organizations and face varied forms of social exclusion. The article is mostly based on secondary sources, as well as on observations.","Document from the year 2018 in the subject Sociology - Gender Studies, grade: A, The University of Kashmir (Department of Sociology), course: PhD, language: English, abstract: Down the ages, our society has condemned and alienated people ...",9783668763760,
289,Saks Fifth Avenue and Transgender Rights,,Timothy Fedderson,"In September 2014 Leyth Jamal, a transgender woman, filed suit against her employer, luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue. Jamal alleged that she experienced harassment from managers and other employees because of her gender identity while employed by Saks, including verbal abuse and threats of violence. At the time she filed suit, no federal, state, or local laws protected transgender employees from discrimination. However, some federal district courts had recently begun to allow such suits on the premise that discrimination based on gender identity was a form of sex discrimination. Other suits and amicus briefs brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) furthered this trend. The EEOC is the federal agency charged with investigating and supporting claims of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, so district and appellate courts watched the EEOC's position on the application of Title VII. Socio-culturally, many Americans supported transgender rights, even as they voiced anxiety about transgender men in women's bathrooms.","In September 2014 Leyth Jamal, a transgender woman, filed suit against her employer, luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue.",1529705487,
291,Today's Transgender Youth,"Health, Well-Being, and Opportunities for Resilience",Taylor & Francis Group,"This book focuses on resiliency among gender expansive young people in different cultures, exploring how they engage with and leverage school, media, and religious contexts. The contributions in this volume advance the scholarship regarding the health and well-being of gender expansive young people, at a time where a plethora of recent legislation has limited and removed sundry rights of transgender individuals. While previous scholarship identified disparities among transgender youth, this book approaches resiliency from multiple lenses - from school-based clubs as tools for engagement in advocacy, to proactivity and self-care as strategies to mitigate struggles. These empirical chapters focus on diverse contexts across different countries including Canada, the USA and Australia. The book also includes important commentaries from leading scholars in the field debating the controversial issue of transgender youth ""desisting"" (to no longer be transgender). This book will be of interest to those studying recent legislation on transgender rights, as well as to those with a broader interest in studying gender in different contexts. This book was originally published as a special issue of the International Journal of Transgenderism.","This book focuses on resiliency among gender expansive young people in different cultures, exploring how they engage with and leverage school, media, and religious contexts.",0367731037,"Today's Transgender Youth Health, Well-Being, and Opportunities for Resilience"
295,Histories of the Transgender Child,,Julian Gill-Peterson,"A groundbreaking twentieth-century history of transgender children With transgender rights front and center in American politics, media, and culture, the pervasive myth still exists that today’s transgender children are a brand new generation—pioneers in a field of new obstacles and hurdles. Histories of the Transgender Child shatters this myth, uncovering a previously unknown twentieth-century history when transgender children not only existed but preexisted the term transgender and its predecessors, playing a central role in the medicalization of trans people, and all sex and gender. Beginning with the early 1900s when children with “ambiguous” sex first sought medical attention, to the 1930s when transgender people began to seek out doctors involved in altering children’s sex, to the invention of the category gender, and finally the 1960s and ’70s when, as the field institutionalized, transgender children began to take hormones, change their names, and even access gender confirmation, Julian Gill-Peterson reconstructs the medicalization and racialization of children’s bodies. Throughout, they foreground the racial history of medicine that excludes black and trans of color children through the concept of gender’s plasticity, placing race at the center of their analysis and at the center of transgender studies. Until now, little has been known about early transgender history and life and its relevance to children. Using a wealth of archival research from hospitals and clinics, including incredible personal letters from children to doctors, as well as scientific and medical literature, this book reaches back to the first half of the twentieth century—a time when the category transgender was not available but surely existed, in the lives of children and parents.","Using a wealth of archival research from hospitals and clinics, including incredible personal letters from children to doctors, as well as scientific and medical literature, this book reaches back to the first half of the twentieth ...",9781452958156,
533,The Transgender Studies Reader,,Susan Stryker,"Transgender studies is the latest area of academic inquiry to grow out of the exciting nexus of queer theory, feminist studies, and the history of sexuality. Because transpeople challenge our most fundamental assumptions about the relationship between bodies, desire, and identity, the field is both fascinating and contentious. The Transgender Studies Reader puts between two covers fifty influential texts with new introductions by the editors that, taken together, document the evolution of transgender studies in the English-speaking world. By bringing together the voices and experience of transgender individuals, doctors, psychologists and academically-based theorists, this volume will be a foundational text for the transgender community, transgender studies, and related queer theory.","Critics of The Well have paid little attention to Hall&#39;s careful account of Stephen&#39;s <br>\nexperience; instead, they have sought to unmask the novel&#39;s various <b>ideologies</b> <br>\nof misogyny and homophobia.

Contributors demonstrate how ‘transgender children and young people’ are invented in different medical, social and political contexts: from specialist gender identity development services to lobby groups and their school resources, gender guides and workbooks; from the world of the YouTube vlogger to the consulting rooms of psychiatrists; from the pharmaceutical industry to television documentaries; and from the developmental models of psychologists to the complexities of intersex medicine. Far from just investigating how they are invented the authors demonstrate the considerable psychological and physical harms perpetrated on children and young people by transgender ideology, and offer tangible examples of where and how adults should intervene to protect them.","The essays in this volume are written by clinicians, psychologists, sociologists, educators, parents and de-transitioners.",9781527541245,
551,Gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender Public Policy Issues,A Citizen's and Administrator's Guide to the New Cultural Struggle,Wallace Swan,"In response to the cultural war declared upon gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people by the radical right, this book gives you an inside look at the gay community’s perspectives on the four major issues of school curricula, workplace protections, legitimization of same-sex relationships, and protections against discrimination. As Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender Public Policy Issues examines the role of radical religious thought in American politics, it looks at the development of conflicts on the national level over the four main issues. It also looks at specific examples of the conflicts, such as the “Rainbow Curriculum” battle in New York City and the controversial school board elections in Des Moines. This insightful and comprehensive book discusses recent successes of the gay and lesbian movement in the development of local public policy as well as setbacks it has experienced. From election year gay-bashing to the persecution of gay and lesbian youth in school environments to lack of protection for gay and lesbian employees in the workplace, it is clear that much work remains to be done before the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered persons are protected to the same degree as those of heterosexual persons.

554,Transgender Identities,,Angie Fee,"Angie Fee argues that there are gaps in the training of counsellors/therapists that leave important issues of sexuality and gender mainly unexplored. The binary categorisation of sexuality into homo and hetero, and gender into man and woman has simplified reduced complex phenomena. She believes that sexuality and gender cannot be summed up by using pathological and biological models alone and more attention needs to be paid to the influence of culture and society. She argues that the cultural is often invisible, so not yet thinkable about in terms of how it influences our own belief system. Angie s work goes beyond calling for tolerance and acceptance and calls for an examination of the influence of heterosexual ideology. Heterosexuality is continually produced and reproduced in social practice and psychological therapies without any exploring into how the concept of heterosexuality came to be constructed. Her interest is in challenging therapy trainings to address the role heterosexuality has in their theories which will then enable a more flexible space for thinking about desires outwith a heteronomative paradigm.",Angie Fee argues that there are gaps in the training of counsellors/therapists that leave important issues of sexuality and gender mainly unexplored.,3843374503,

The transgender world view says that laws should recognise a person's fluid `gender identity' other than, or in place of, their fixed biological sex. Transgenderism has many conundrums. Are we all on a spectrum between 100 percent male and 100 per cent female, or are we all just male or female? Should biological girls be obliged to accept biological boys who identify as women in their safe spaces at schools? Should two biological men who identify as women be recognised as lesbians? Activists demand gender neutral language, sports, restrooms, change rooms, etc. This treats men and women as same-same, uniform... one shade of grey.

Essays are written against the grain of the popularised medical definition of ‘the transgender child’ as a young person whose ‘true’ gender lies in the brain, or pre-social ‘identity’. Contributors contest this diagnosis from a range of perspectives, including as social theorists, psychotherapists, persons living as transgender, individuals who have de-transitioned, and parents of adolescents identifying as transgender. They argue that medicine, social policy and the law build ideas about ‘the transgender child’, and contend that it is politics, not science, which accounts for the exponential rise in the number of children diagnosed as transgender by gender identity clinics. They conclude that today’s medical and social trend for transgendering children is not liberal and progressive, but politically reactionary, physically and psychologically dangerous and abusive.",This book is a collection of essays about the current theory and practice of transgendering children.,9781527510364,Transgender Children and Young People Born in Your Own Body
