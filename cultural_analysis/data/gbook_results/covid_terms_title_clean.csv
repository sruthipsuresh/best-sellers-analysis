12,Reversing Population Growth Swiftly and Painlessly,A Simple Two-Credit System to Regulate Birth Rates and Immigration,William Brodovich,"Population growth hastens the depletion of natural resources, degrades the environment, increases poverty and conflict, and debases the human spirit. This book offers an antidote. It prescribes a simple and practical credit-based system that can gradually reduce any population to an optimal size without imposing a limit on the number of children a couple can produce. It does this without requiring anyone to violate the moral precepts of any of the world's major faiths regarding birth control and abortion. And it shows how to use the same system to rationally regulate immigration. After presenting the plan, the author explores the demographic, social, environmental, and economic changes that would likely accompany population reduction, and proposes innovative solutions for some of our most pressing problems, including poverty. Anyone with an interest in the future of mankind and the conservation of the natural world will find this book informative, original, thought-provoking, and hopeful.","Population growth hastens the depletion of natural resources, degrades the environment, increases poverty and conflict, and debases the human spirit.

14,A Population-Based Policy and Systems Change Approach to Prevent and Control Hypertension,,Institute of Medicine,"Hypertension is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, affecting nearly one in three Americans. It is prevalent in adults and endemic in the older adult population. Hypertension is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and disability. Although there is a simple test to diagnose hypertension and relatively inexpensive drugs to treat it, the disease is often undiagnosed and uncontrolled. A Population-Based Policy and Systems Change Approach to the Prevention and Control Hypertension identifies a small set of high-priority areas in which public health officials can focus their efforts to accelerate progress in hypertension reduction and control. It offers several recommendations that embody a population-based approach grounded in the principles of measurement, system change, and accountability. The recommendations are designed to shift current hypertension reduction strategies from an individual-based approach to a population-based approach. They are also designed to improve the quality of care provided to individuals with hypertension and to strengthen the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's leadership in seeking a reduction in the sodium intake in the American diet to meet dietary guidelines. The book is an important resource for federal public health officials and organizations, especially the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as medical professionals and community health workers.","The book is an important resource for federal public health officials and organizations, especially the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as medical professionals and community health workers.",9780309148092,
17,Estimation of Population Reduction and Gene Flow in the Rare Orchid Isotria Medeoloides,,Philip Crystal,"Isotria medeoloides (Pursh) Raf. is a threatened orchid species with an Appalachian distribution in the eastern United States. There are only 150 populations, 67 of which are in Maine and New Hampshire. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service is attempting to preserve the species by protecting populations and potential colonization sites. Previous microsatellite analysis of fifteen populations throughout the species revealed low genetic diversity and high inbreeding. This study uses four microsatellite loci to determine gene flow, effective population sizes, and population size reductions among eighteen populations in order to identify genetically important sites. Results indicate that populations in the southern range of the species are severely reduced. The relatively diverse northern populations also show signs of population decline. A coalescent genealogy sampler revealed low gene flow with most populations sending and receiving less than one migrant per generation. Gene flow was especially low among small southern populations.",Isotria medeoloides (Pursh) Raf. is a threatened orchid species with an Appalachian distribution in the eastern United States.,OCLC:871573651,

The results indicate that a reduction of income inequality leads to lower fertility and mortality, to improvedbasic needs satisfaction, and to lower labour force participation of young and old males and of females in Asia and Africa. The effect of income distribution on saving and consumption is found to be negligible. These outcomes suggest that family planning and health policies in LDCs will show better results when they are supplemented with policies aimed at makingthe poor benefit from economic growth. As regards development policy, the results indicate that a reduction of income inequality does not impair the formation of physical capital, but enhances the formation of human capital and lowers the growth rate of the labour force.","In this book, a model of long-term interrelationships between income distribution, population growth and economic development is developed and estimated from data for 54 countries.",9783642785719,"Population Growth, Income Distribution, and Economic Development Theory, Methodology, and Empirical Results"

38,Coping with Population Challenges,,Louise Lassonde,"Despite rapidly decreasing rates of population growth caused by reduced fertility in the majority of world regions, demographers are predicting that the world's population will still double by the year 2050. The question is therefore no longer the traditional one of whether the planet can support so many people, but how to provide a sustainable future for ten billion individuals. Quantitative problems have become ethical ones. Coping with Population Challenges addresses these issues in the context of international debate and agreements since the first World Population Plan of Action in 1974 to the 20-year Programme of Action adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994. The author describes how the Programme of Action focuses on women's issues, reproductive choice and the notion of the individual. However, she identifies a number of important but neglected areas of the debate that the Programme failed to address and brings to light some of the inconsistencies that need to be resolved if the Programme is to be implemented. The author also looks at the underlying ethical dimension of all choices relating to the population issue and suggests measures and machinery for giving effect to states' commitments, including reformulating problems and defining the appropriate economic framework for solutions. The book is an excellent introduction for the non-specialist to a very topical debate, and a useful reference for researchers.","The book is an excellent introduction for the non-specialist to a very topical debate, and a useful reference for researchers.",9781134065615,

45,Too Many Humans,The Imperative to Return to a Human Population of 1 Billion,Morrison Bonpasse,"This ""Little Green Book"" presents 21 proposals for reducing the size of the human population to 1 billion people, in order to enable humanity to live sustainably on Earth. For centuries and millennia, humans have exploited the inherited riches of the Earth without significant observable permanent harm. The Industrial Revolution, which used non-human, non-animal power sources to accomplish tasks, began in the 18th century in Europe and North America. In the early 19th century, that power increasingly came from the burning of fossil fuels, primarily coal and oil, and that burning created carbon dioxide. The ills of fossil fuel burning were compounded by population growth. Around the beginning of the 19th century, medical and nutritional advances led to the reduction of the death rate and populations began to grow more rapidly. This change can be said to be the beginning of the Demographic Transition, which is defined as the period during which there is a large gap between the declining death rate and the subsequent reduction of the birth rate which typically occurs several generations later. Proposed here are additional stages of the model to show a Sustainable Demographic Transition (SDT) to a human population of 1 billion, which was the population of the Earth around 1800. The question posed in this book is whether the human birth rate can be reduced soon enough to avoid much of the potential further damage to the Earth, and reduced further to enable remediation of previous damage. The year 1800 is chosen in this book as the pivotal year for the Industrial Revolution and Demographic Transition. At that time, the carbon dioxide density in the atmosphere was approximately 300 parts per million. During the subsequent 215 years, the Industrial Revolution accelerated and, together with exponential population growth, has degraded the ability of the Earth to sustain life. Whatever damage to the Earth the Industrial Revolution would have produced for a planet supporting one billion humans, that damage has been multiplied, so far, by the growth of the human population since 1800 to 7.3 billion by mid-2015. If not stopped, the multiplier will continue to grow. Even at the current and seemingly slow annual growth rate of 1.2%, the Earth's population will double to 14.6 billion in 58 years. Such a total is inconceivable, and avoidable. There has been debate about whether the sheer number of people is the problem or whether their unequal or excessive consumption patterns are the problem. The problem with that debate is that it poses a false choice, which need not be resolved here. That is, while there is no question that there is substantial inequality among people of income and wealth and therefore, of Earth-degrading consumption, there is also no question that every human being has an impact on the Earth. Putting it simply, more humans produce more carbon. Further, more humans have produced too many more humans. There are two basic elements of each human's impact on the Earth. First s/he consumes energy and resources, and s/he has the capacity to have children. Whatever the world's consumption patterns, there will be less consumption and Earth degradation when there are fewer people. This truth is a corollary to the message of population stabilization advocates since the 1970s - ""Whatever your cause, it's a lost cause until we control population growth."" The first of the 21 proposals is that all humans be encouraged to have no children, or at most, one child. The alternative to achieving population reduction through voluntary means is to endure catastrophes and collapse and gross reduction of biodiversity.","This &quot;Little Green Book&quot; presents 21 proposals for reducing the size of the human population to 1 billion people, in order to enable humanity to live sustainably on Earth.",1506176569,Too Many Humans The Imperative to Return to a Human Population of 1 Billion
47,Population Policy and the U.S. Constitution,,L.D. Barnett,"A few decades ago a monograph on the legal aspects of population control would have looked mainly at legal prohibitions. The salient legal problems were restriction of the use of birth control and dissemination of information about it. The assumption in such an approach would have been that effective population control is legally affected only by the clearly stated restrictions in the law. In other respects, the law could be assumed to be neutral. Judicial and legislative changes have eliminated practically all restrictions on the means of contraception. This development, how ever, has not freed population from its relation to the law; on the contrary, it has exposed the importance of law as a motivating force for and against population control. Although much applied work in population control is directed toward the distribution of contracep tives, concentration on the means of population control has shown itself to be of doubtful value. From many sides the primary impor tance of motivation has been recognized, along with the need to influence motivation and to analyze the conditions under which motivational change is possible. At this point the role of the law ix X FOREWORD becomes apparent, along with the recognition that law has not been neutral in this issue-that, in fact, it cannot be neutral. Larry Barnett has undertaken a pioneering effort in identifying the areas of law important to changing people's motivations in regard to population control and to a reduction in individual family size.",Larry Barnett has undertaken a pioneering effort in identifying the areas of law important to changing people&#39;s motivations in regard to population control and to a reduction in individual family size.,9401727201,
49,Effects of Thermosonication on Microbial Population Reduction and Solubillity Index in Skim Milk Powder,,Nicola F. Beatty,"The effects of thermosonication (high intensity ultrasound coupled with thermal treatment), on the reduction of thermophilic spore-forming microorganisms and its effects on the solubility index in reconstituted skim milk powder (RSMP) were evaluated. Thermosonication was applied to RSMP at various solids concentrations, temperatures, and lengths of time based on commercial milk powder processing conditions. Microbial counts were determined prior to and after treatments to determine the log reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilusvegetative cells and spores. Log reductions were recorded, and data were analyzed by response surface analysis. The log reductions induced by temperature and time without high intensity ultrasound (HIU) were compared to reductions observed with HIU. Thermosonication was also applied to RSMP to determine effects on solubility using a continuous flow cell system. Thermosonication yielded a significantly higher level of microbial destruction for both vegetative cells and spores than heat treatment alone. For experiments involving vegetative cells, the interaction of treatment time and temperature proved to have the greatest influence on microbial inactivation. In comparison, the interaction of total solids content and length of HIU treatment demonstrated the greatest effect on the increased log reductions for spores. The solubility of RSMP treated with HIU did not significantly differ from the solubility of RSMP not treated with HIU. Further data showed the implementation of HIU, or thermosonication, during milk powder processing would be most effective before and after the evaporation stage when the total solids content of product is 9.2% and 50% at 75℗ʻC and 60℗ʻC, respectively. Based on preliminary data, it is assumed HIU applied for 10 s at these two locations would produce an additive effect, thereby reducing overall microbial counts by 5.76 log and 0.51 log for G. stearothermophilus vegetative cells and spores, respectively, in the product prior to entering the drying stage. All research findings and observations suggest HIU, or thermosonication, to be a successful method for reducing microbial populations during milk powder processing without sacrificing skim milk powder solubility","The effects of thermosonication (high intensity ultrasound coupled with thermal treatment), on the reduction of thermophilic spore-forming microorganisms and its effects on the solubility index in reconstituted skim milk powder (RSMP) were ...",OCLC:970169272,
55,Relocating world Population for Reducing GHG Emission,,Subhash Lele,"The dominance of high energy consuming nations and the blame game seems to defeat the purpose of the Kyoto protocol in limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius. In the Paris approach in 2015 voluntary targets from individual nations, indicate such commitments will unlock investments that ratchet up ambition on reducing emissions and eventually achieve the low-carbon world that all sides want. The studies show that the countries with highest emission are least vulnerable to climate change effects like rise in sea level, effects on flora and fauna etc. but the most vulnerable countries are African and small island countries which have little contribution to GHG (Green House Gases) emission. It is ironical and unjust for these developing and underdeveloped countries. It is a common saying that when normal methods fail to yield results, an ‘Out of the Box’ measure only may work. Out of multiple options discussed the book, the most acceptable option (and a few may think outrageous looking into political and social fabric of these countries) can be to relocate the population in EU28 countries, Canada and United States to effectively reduce global energy consumption. Author feels, Implementation of this measure, may give us, a reduction in energy consumption by a modest 10-15 % and can result in reduction of @ 1? C in global temperature.

103,We're All in This Together - Help Through Stressful and Depressive Times,,Jess Miller,"Jess Miller's 'We're All In This Together' has helped many people get themselves through stressful and depressive periods in their lives. Jess outlines how we gradually get battered down by the system of life we live under until we finally cave in and reach the darkness of depression, but that this is a normal place for human beings to find themselves in. After all each of us has a different level of resistance to stress so it's hardly surprising that many of us succumb to its battering and become depressed. Once we're in the darkness though there are things that we can do for ourselves to help us find our way back to the light. Jess gives you twelve easy yet powerful self-help therapies, his 'Neil Armstrongs' being one small step that becomes a giant leap away from the darkness of stress, tension, loneliness and depression. These easy yet powerful self-help therapies get you to slow everything down that is going on in your life and do things for yourself whilst truly appreciating what you are doing. They stop you being reactive to the things that have made you stressed and depressed and you become proactive for yourself in simple ways that push the 'noise' going on in your life away so you can enter a period of calm in which your mind and body can start to mend. For people who are all up and together, rushing through their lives utterly convinced they are living the right way these therapies may seem trivial, but for someone who is hurting in the darkness of depression and whose life has become surreal they are of real value. By understanding the stressful descent into depression, what it's like when you're there, how you've joined countless millions of human beings who go through this experience and the things you can do for yourself to help you find your way back to the light, you will be giving yourself every chance of making that journey and returning to a much happier life. This book is not written for those suffering from bipolar or manic depression, although many of the symptoms and their effects are the same, rather it's for everyday people who are existing under extreme stress or feeling really down, giving them the proven therapies Jess used to bring himself back from the darkness. Book excerpt: NEIL ARMSTRONG 2 THOUGHTLESSNESS 'It is important for you to accept that you cannot do what you did before. You may be able to do those things again one day, but right now your fractured consciousness cannot take more than one small step at a time. So here is another small step: You do whatever it takes to find somewhere quiet to sit and relax undisturbed and then close your eyes and try to banish all thought from your mind so that you can simply drift in a panacea without a single, solitary thought entering your mind. This is hard to do when you are in the darkness with your mind racing and careering around as a response to not being able to function properly and at first you might find this exercise nigh on impossible. When I first tried to do this I was in the darkness and it was not two seconds before a thought entered my mind. Today I can hold that drifting, thoughtless state for about as long as I want, which is interesting considering that for many years my teachers wrote on my school reports that this was precisely what I was brilliant at doing in class. But if you are able to manage just a few seconds of thoughtlessness and then practice at extending that amount of time, you will find your consciousness thanks you for it. It thanks you for not having to work at all, not having to continually process all those thoughts for the first time in years? And you will feel the difference. Go ahead and try it. You are doing something that enables your consciousness to rest and believe me when I tell you that it needs to be rested more and more.....","This book is not written for those suffering from bipolar or manic depression, although many of the symptoms and their effects are the same, rather it&#39;s for everyday people who are existing under extreme stress or feeling really down, ...",0956583121,

Infuriated by the senseless slaughter, she determines to find the perpetrators.Back home in New York, she learns of a secret group called Population Office for the World, whose five members, all scientists, believe that the only way to save the future earth from human-caused destruction is by reducing the world's population at any cost. When the entire population of San Ignacio, a small California city, is wiped out by an aerosolized toxin, Chloe is sure this group is responsible. She tracks down the group's leaders, but is captured and, in order to survive, agrees to write an article for them.The article, intended to convince the world to take population control seriously, will announce the date of the next strike but not its location--which will be Phoenix, Arizona. As disturbing as the strike itself is Chloe's discovery that the toxin originates from deep-sea corals, whose DNA is spliced into the genome of E. coli bacteria that, unlike the usual attenuated laboratory bacteria, can potentially share their genes with the E. coli that inhabit the bowels of every person on earth.Although she has come to agree with the group's message, if not its methods, her escape is now even more urgent, to save not just her own life, but that of the residents of Phoenix and possibly millions of other people as well.","While working for a humane organization in Kenya, Chloe Freestaff, a twentysomething magazine writer, finds evidence of a mass murder in a remote grassland.",1543924492,

133,Simulation of Cattle Cycle Demography,Cohort Analysis of Recruitment and Culling Decisions in the National Beef Cow Herd,Thomas Lee Nordblom,"This study expresses the hypothesis that historical patterns of national beef cow herd accumulation and liquidations (the cattle cycle) have been related to investment incentive differences across cow ages through time, resulting each year in changes in herd age structure, performance and potentials for adjustment in subsequent years. A review of national cattle cycle literature reveals the common assumption of variable heifer recruitment levels through time to the mature cow herd. A review of firm level cattle cycle stategy studies shows that most which considered heterogeneous herds (distinguishing performance by cow age) ironically assumed constant recruitment in proportion to cow numbers. Farmer interviews indicated that heifer recruitment may vary widely in proportion to cow numbers from year to year and that there are strong tendencies to cull non-pregnant and unsound cows from the herd at any age. The present study assumes both variable recruitment and age heterogenity. A search and synthesis of the biological literature allowed expression of economically important attributes as point estimates from continuous functions of cow age. These attributes are conception rates, health rates, cow survival rates, cull cow body weights, calf survival rates and weaning weights. Based on these biological parameters, and on the assumption that non-pregnant and unsound cows would be culled, retainment and culling rates are defined as management expectation parameters. These biological and expectation parameters are the building blocks of a simulation model designed to make value comparisons between cows of different ages and pregnancy status and to trace out changes in the national cow herd age structure through time. A budget generator produces estimates of expected net annual revenues for each of the 26 discrete age and pregnancy classes of heifers and cows, in each year from 1950 through 1978, based on exogenous price and cost series. These estimates are used to project the present values of expected future net revenues for each class of breeding animals. The ratio of future breeding value to present cull slaughter value is calculated for each of the 26 classes, each year. These V-ratios, in turn, are decision variables for determining the proportions of animals in each class to be retained in the herd, simulated by a national beef cow demography model. Annual summations from the demography model are compared with objective historical series of January 1 inventories of beef cows and replacement heifers, and annual numbers of cull cows slaughtered and beef calves born. The model's simplicity, ignoring related livestock sectors, is one of its significant features. With its few exogenous price and cost variables, simple biological relationships and management assumptions, the model is able to track the historical numbers of beef cows and calves born quite well. Mean proportional absolute deviations (MPAD) of the simulated series from the objective historical series were computed in addition to simple correlation coefficients and Theil's coefficients of inequality. In a display run, the tracking behavior of the model was best for cow inventories and calves born, and worst for heifer recruitment and cull cows, with MPAD's of .029, .036, .172, and .261, respectively. Theil's coefficients of inequality were .405, .587, .962, and .842, respectively. In an alternative run, with parameters set to reflect the assumption that all cows have the same performance characteristics across ages, the tracking behavior of the model was in several aspects about as good as the display run. Thus, the null hypothesis that performance differences across cow ages are of no importance in explaining investment behavior could not be rejected. Simulated national beef cow herd age structure changes through cattle cycles are shown from 1950 through 1978.",Mean proportional absolute deviations (MPAD) of the simulated series from the objective historical series were computed in addition to simple correlation coefficients and Theil&#39;s coefficients of inequality.,OCLC:7991138,Simulation of Cattle Cycle Demography Cohort Analysis of Recruitment and Culling Decisions in the National Beef Cow Herd

142,Genetic and Phenotypic Studies on Culling in Quebec Holstein Cows,,João Walter Dürr,"""A series of studies were conducted to evaluate genetic and phenotypic aspects of culling, herd life and survival in Quebec Holstein herds. Data consisted of lactation records obtained from the Programme d'Analyse des Troupeaux Laitiers du Quebec (PATLQ) files, which included 2.2 Million records before the editing procedures. The average productive herd life in Quebec herds was approximately 33 months, corresponding to an average replacement rate of MIND, for both milk recording options. Herds enrolled in the PATLQ official option had cows with longer calving intervals and culled their heifers earlier than herds in the owner sampler option. The probability of being culled for each major reason for disposal was assessed by logistic regression models, and it was shown that culling for low production (voluntary) had a clearly descending trend from 1981 to 1994, while involuntary culling (assumed to include all the reasons other than production) increased in importance mainly because of the ascending trends observed for cuffing due to reproductive problems, mastitis and feet and legs problems. Proportion of cows culled for involuntary reasons increased with parity number, but the opposite occurred for culling due to low production. Herds in the official option culled less for mastitis and sold more cows for dairy purposes than owner sampler herds. After these preliminary studies, a sequence of Weibull models were fitted to analyze different aspects of the data. The genetic study of herd life traits focused on differences between sires regarding true and functional herd life, but also described the effect of different explanatory variables on the failure time variable. Heritability for true and functional herd life was, respectively, 0.09 and 0.08 in the log scale and 0.19 and 0.15 in the original scale. The difference in the median survival time of daughters of bulls with extreme proofs for functional herd life was 1.7 lactations.

160,Thinking Through Badgers,Researching the controversy over bovine tuberculosis and the culling of badgers,Stephan Price,"Bovine tuberculosis is seriously damaging the UK dairy and beef industry. Many farmers believe culling badgers must be part of the solution, but in 2013 a record 300,000 people signed a Downing Street petition asking the government to stop planned culls of badgers in Somerset and Gloucestershire, fuelling media controversy and signalling the beginning of a social conflict that was acted out in studios, streets, fields and village halls across England. The four-year trial culls, which began that year, aimed to establish that culling was a viable way of tackling the disease, but the widely divergent experiences and values of policy-makers, farming, conservation and animal welfare supporters means that decades of science on the disease in badgers and the effects of culling has not helped resolve the dispute. Reporting on original, UK research council-funded social science, this book takes on the challenge of understanding the contrasting views involved. Listening carefully to what the different protagonists have to say, the book unpicks the way science is interpreted to sustain differing conclusions, and considers how social science thinking could contribute. The book develops a critical perspective on the increasingly important literature influenced by new materialism, the social science response to the Science Wars, and explores the extent to which a social movement around opposition to the culls is emerging. In approachable prose, this access-all-areas account describes the struggle to develop understanding through the messy process of research and the difficulties of scientific analysis and philosophical thought. As such, it provides a valuable resource for both research practitioners and teachers within the social sciences, as well as an accessible way for biological scientists, conservationists and farmers to reflect on the issues around the management of disease in livestock and wildlife.","Reporting on original, UK research council-funded social science, this book takes on the challenge of understanding the contrasting views involved.",9781622731879,Thinking Through Badgers Researching the controversy over bovine tuberculosis and the culling of badgers

192,Take Me Home,Protecting America's Vulnerable Children and Families,Jill Duerr Berrick,"There is a profound crisis in the United States' foster care system, Jill Duerr Berrick writes in this expertly researched, passionately written book. No state has passed the federally mandated Child and Family Service Review; two-thirds of the state systems have faced class-action lawsuits demanding change; and most tellingly, well over half of all children who enter foster care never go home. The field of child welfare has lost its way and is neglecting its fundamental responsibility to the most vulnerable children and families in America.The family stories Berrick weaves throughout the chapters provide a vivid backdrop for her statistics. Amanda, raised in foster care, began having children of her own while still a teen and lost them to the system when she became addicted to drugs. Tracy, brought up by her schizophrenic single mother, gave birth to the first of eight children at age fourteen and saw them all shuffled through foster care as she dealt drugs and went to prison. Both they and the other individuals that Berrick features spent years without adequate support from social workers or the government before finally achieving a healthier life; many people never do. But despite the clear crisis in child welfare, most calls for reform have focused on unproven prevention methods, not on improving the situation for those already caught in the system. Berrick argues that real child welfare reform will only occur when the centerpiece of child welfare - reunification, permanency, and foster care - is reaffirmed.Take Me Home reminds us that children need long-term caregivers who can help them develop and thrive. When troubled parents can't change enough to permit reunification, alternative permanency options must be pursued. And no reform will matter for the hundreds of thousands of children entering foster care each year in America unless their experience of out-of-home care is considerably better than the one many now experience. Take Me Home offers prescriptions for policy change and strategies for parents, social workers, and judges struggling with permanency decisions. Readers will come away reinvigorated in their thinking about how to get children to the homes they need.","Reynolds, A.J., Chang, H., &amp; Temple, <b>J. A.</b> (1998).

200,You Can Take the Boy Out of the Bay: The Memoirs of Thomas Graham Morry of Ferryland,,Thomas Graham Morry,"""You Can Take the Boy Out of the Bay..."" is a collection of anecdotes recalling people and events in the life of Thomas Graham Morry. These mini short stories were written by him with the intention to amuse but, when examined carefully, they also contain underlying compassion, empathy and pathos. Tom Morry was born and raised in Ferryland, a tiny outport community on the Southern Shore of Newfoundland. The book focusses first and foremost on his experiences in that part of his life, and gives a bittersweet account of life in outport Newfoundland during the Depression Years, when poverty was an underlying theme in the lives of virtually everyone in the village - a theme they chose to ignore in order that they could live life to the fullest, despite the hardships.But the story goes well beyond that, recounting the experiences he had, and the odd selection of characters that he encountered, during his years that followed, in the United States in the Dirty Thirties, and back in Newfoundland, in St. John's this time, during and after WWII, and before and after Confederation. The story finishes up with a brief exposure to life in Ottawa for an ex-patriate Newfoundlander in the early 1950s and 60s, where he found characters as delightfully eccentric as he had encountered during his earlier life experiences, proving, once again, that we humans are more alike than we are different.","A collection of anecdotes recalling people and events in the author&#39;s life, these mini short stories were written by him with the intention to amuse but, when examined carefully, they also contain underlying compassion, empathy, and pathos.",1775353524,

How is it transmitted? How do you protect yourself? Then keep reading... The Wuhan Coronavirus we are facing today is known to scientists under different names: 2019-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19. The last one, COVID-19, is the one we'll be employing throughout this book. COVID-19 is one of many coronaviruses: viruses of the family Coronaviridae. There are several of them, and although they all share the same basic molecular structure, not all of them can infect humans: different coronaviruses strains have been found in birds and in various mammals including bats, dogs, mice, cats, camels, and masked palm civets. Among the coronaviruses that are pathogenic (can cause a disease) to humans, most only cause mild clinical symptoms, similar to a common cold. Today's COVID-19 is another exception to the non-threatening nature of most members of the Coronaviridae family. It was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, among people who had visited the Huanan seafood market and became ill with an unidentified form or viral lung infection. As of February 2020, it has amply surpassed SARS-CoV in number of cases and deaths. All three of these Coronaviruses, COVID-19, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from virus strains that infect animals, and through the process of genetic mutation acquired the ability to infect human hosts. Disease transmission from animals is known as zoonotic transmission, and the animals in question are known as the viruses' reservoir hosts. The MERS virus reservoir host, the animal it originally infected, is the dromedary camel, while the SARS reservoir hosts are thought to be bats. Through laboratory procedures known as genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, scientists have been able to suggest that bats might also be the original host of the new COVID-19 virus, although it is unclear whether another animal which was sold at the incriminated seafood market in Wuhan might have acted as intermediate host, enabling the spread of the infection to humans. What is most important for us is that the new COVID-19 virus can not only infect humans who come in contact with animal hosts, but also be transmitted from human to human. This book consists of a complete guide on the following: What is a coronavirus? How it spread in the community Who is most risk? What are the symptoms? What is the virus spread?

233,COVID-19,The Greatest Cover-Up in History—From Wuhan to the White House,Dylan Howard,"In the final days of 2019, a new and deadly virus was quietly spreading through the city of Wuhan, China. Within six months it would kill half a million people worldwide, infect a further 10 million, and change the way all of us live, work and play forever. Now, for the first time, the real story of the greatest global crisis of the age can be told. Reporters Dylan Howard and Dominic Utton, collaborating from New York and London—infection hotspots in what would become two of the worst-hit nations on Earth—have together mapped the rise, spread and impact of the virus . . . and uncovered some explosive revelations. COVID-19: The Greatest Cover-Up in History—From Wuhan to the White House delivers the unfettered truth about what is undoubtedly the biggest political scandal of our time. It shows in unprecedented detail how governments in China, the UK, and the US not only failed to protect their citizens from the threat of the disease, but actively conspired to put their own political and economic ideologies above the lives of ordinary people. From early attempts by Beijing to silence any reports of the new virus to the inability of the WHO to act decisively; from warnings received and ignored by President Trump to decisions taken by the UK government that directly led to the loss of tens of thousands of lives; from whispers of military experiments to outlandish 5G conspiracy theories, Howard and Utton separate fact from fiction, science from hysteria, and expose a trail of dead bodies, wilful mismanagement, incompetence, arrogance, deliberate cover-ups, and outrageous lies that raise serious questions about who is really responsible for the hundreds of thousands killed by COVID-19. Through vigorous investigations, dedicated reporting, and exclusive first-person sourcing, COVID-19 unearths a more complex understanding of the rise, spread, and consequences of the first six months of the pandemic than has yet been seen, and exposes shocking revelations about the roles and motivations of the American and British governments in the crisis. The true story of COVID-19 is not just that of a silent killer that suddenly invaded the world . . . it’s the scandal of a global tragedy that could have—and should have—been prevented. The real number of deaths and infections from the virus will never be known. The figures have not only been underreported in China, but by supposedly transparent governments in the West for reasons less connected with public safety and more to do with their own mendacity, incompetence, and corruption. Written with the urgency and tension of a thriller novel but grounded in rigorously factual reporting, COVID-19 is the essential read on the most horrifying scandal of our age.",The true story of COVID-19 is not just that of a silent killer that suddenly invaded the world . . . it’s the scandal of a global tragedy that could have—and should have—been prevented.,9781510765344,COVID-19 The Greatest Cover-Up in History—From Wuhan to the White House

Connor,"Are you worried about Wuhan Coronavirus Outbreak because there are some sick people in your country? Do you want to know what a coronavirus is and how you can protect yourself and your family from a pandemic spread? You are right and this book is for you! We do know that the Wuhan Virus (2019-nCoV) has about 14 days incubation period, so it means I could get sick now and I will be able to transmit that virus for about two weeks before I start showing symptoms. For this reason, I could theoretically be sick right now and not showing any symptoms, but I can walk around and get other people sick. So, it's something to think about: how many of those spreading people are out there right now? Right now, a lot of people in western countries don't believe that this is going to turn into a serious situation so you don't have people stocking up that heavily yet, but once we get a few more confirmed cases people will start panicking and start ordering supplies. You wouldn't be able to get batteries, water, food, masks, gloves. Things like that are all going to run out once people start panicking. For this reason, you have to use discernment and your own common sense. Reading this book you will learn: What a virus is and how it works What coronavirus is and their effect The New Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV symptoms and clinical considerations The New Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Death Rate How the Wuhan Coronavirus is Transmitted How to protect yourself and your family from the new Wuhan Coronavirus How to be ready for a Quarantine (Stock Food, Prepare Your Home, Create an Emergency Plan) How to protect yourself if you have to go out during a pandemic spread.

243,WUHAN CORONAVIRUS: The Human Love Stories,Live To Dedicate And Love,Dr. Timothy Zahar,"Memories comeback Dr. Li's sacrifice reminds me of heroic doctor Carlo Urbani. Carlo Urbani (19 October 1956 - March 29, 2003) was an Italian doctor and microbiologist and the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as a new and dangerously contagious viral disease. Although he became infected and died, his early warning to the World Health Organization (WHO) triggered a swift and global response credited with saving numerous lives. Nobody wants to face the high-risk epidemic but there is no cure. But as ordered from the heart, they - the doctors wearing white blouses - still ""rushed"" close to care and treatment for the sick. Entering the special isolation room, in front of them is the life of the patient, behind them is the family, the young wife, the young child. More than anyone else, it is the doctors who know what the patient needs, and every second that passes through the information on coronavirus deaths, the hearts of doctors like us are cramped. ""The mission of the doctor is to come to the side of the patient,"" says Dr. Carlo Urbani as engraved into the heart and became a philosophy of action for all those who are wearing a white blouse to save people. And the same saying, 17 years ago brought him to Hanoi, Vietnam (2003) and then held hands with each medical staff, came to each hospital bed to comfort each patient to overcome the dangerous SARS - CoV pandemic. Actually, Dr. Carlo has the right to refuse to come to Vietnam. But instead of giving up his job to return home safely, he chose to stay in Vietnam to fight the SARS pandemic. 17 years ago with SARS-CoV, Dr. Carlo Urbani died to bring humanity to life. And today with the Covid-19 epidemic, white blouse angels always come to the sick person, do their best to save the lives of the sick. So, instead of bewilderment, fear, believe that one day we will win the disease. Why Must You Read This Book? When crisis occurs, panic envelops us. There are people who act like ""not a human being"". That makes us lose faith in life. When a coronavirus pandemic occurred. The first few days, the society in my country was a little disturbed. * The government strives to implement measures to protect the people. * But the people were panicking, jostling and pushing each other to buy masks and hand sanitizer. * Drug stores take advantage of people's panic and increase prices by 10-20 times as usual. And if we keep seeing those things, we will be even more panicked. The more you see that this life is just taking advantage of each other, not human anymore. However, the following days. I began to see ""beautiful"" and deeply moving actions again: * The government strictly enforces the stabilization of market prices. Willing to deter the ransom between pandemics. * Young business people bring each box of masks to give free to people. * Farmers who cannot sell to China, have been assisted by retailers to distribute to consumers. * Especially when witnessing the touching stories of my colleagues - Chinese medical doctors - who are day and night directly ""fighting"" in the heart of Wuhan. I really feel: THIS WORLD IS STILL FULL OF LOVE BETWEEN HUMAN WITH HUMAN. It touched my heart. It helped me act more drastically to live useful to society. I believe that when you read the stories I have collected in this book, you will feel that LOVE. You will be motivated by it to live stronger and more productive.","So, instead of bewilderment, fear, believe that one day we will win the disease. Why Must You Read This Book?

249,Wuhan Diary,Dispatches from a Quarantined City,Fang Fang,"From one of China’s most acclaimed and decorated writers comes a powerful first-person account of life in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak. On January 25, 2020, after the central government imposed a lockdown in Wuhan, acclaimed Chinese writer Fang Fang began publishing an online diary. In the days and weeks that followed, Fang Fang’s nightly postings gave voice to the fears, frustrations, anger, and hope of millions of her fellow citizens, reflecting on the psychological impact of forced isolation, the role of the internet as both community lifeline and source of misinformation, and most tragically, the lives of neighbors and friends taken by the deadly virus. A fascinating eyewitness account of events as they unfold, Wuhan Diary captures the challenges of daily life and the changing moods and emotions of being quarantined without reliable information. Fang Fang finds solace in small domestic comforts and is inspired by the courage of friends, health professionals and volunteers, as well as the resilience and perseverance of Wuhan’s nine million residents. But, by claiming the writer ́s duty to record she also speaks out against social injustice, abuse of power, and other problems which impeded the response to the epidemic and gets herself embroiled in online controversies because of it. As Fang Fang documents the beginning of the global health crisis in real time, we are able to identify patterns and mistakes that many of the countries dealing with the novel coronavirus have later repeated. She reminds us that, in the face of the new virus, the plight of the citizens of Wuhan is also that of citizens everywhere. As Fang Fang writes: “The virus is the common enemy of humankind; that is a lesson for all humanity. The only way we can conquer this virus and free ourselves from its grip is for all members of humankind to work together.” Blending the intimate and the epic, the profound and the quotidian, Wuhan Diary is a remarkable record of an extraordinary time.","As Fang Fang documents the beginning of the global health crisis in real time, we are able to identify patterns and mistakes that many of the countries dealing with the novel coronavirus have later repeated.",9780063052659,Wuhan Diary Dispatches from a Quarantined City

532,A Different Face of War,Memories of a Medical Service Corps Officer in Vietnam,James G. Van Straten,"A Different Face of War is a riveting account of a Medical Service Corps officer’s activities during the early years of the Vietnam War. Assigned as the senior medical advisor to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam in I Corps, an area close to the DMZ, James G. Van Straten traveled extensively and interacted with military officers and non-commissioned officers, peasant-class farmers, Buddhist bonzes, shopkeepers, scribes, physicians, nurses, the mentally ill, and even political operatives. He sent his wife daily letters from July 1966 through June 1967, describing in impressive detail his experiences, and those letters became the primary source for his memoir. The author describes with great clarity and poignancy the anguish among the survivors when an American cargo plane in bad weather lands short of the Da Nang Air Base runway on Christmas Eve and crashes into a Vietnamese coastal village, killing more than 100 people and destroying their village; the heart-wrenching pleadings of a teenage girl that her shrapnel-ravaged leg not be amputated; and the anger of an American helicopter pilot who made repeated trips into a hot landing zone to evacuate the wounded, only to have the Vietnamese insist that the dead be given a higher priority.","When she got to the two dozen <b>diapers</b> and the package of safety pins she was <br>\nperplexed, never having seen a <b>diaper</b> before.

For many women, the increasingly established online community of “mommyblogs” now provides a source of camaraderie and support that acknowledges both the work of mothering and the implications of its undertaking. Beyond their capacity to entertain, how have mommyblogs shifted our understanding of twenty-first-century motherhood? In examining the content of hundreds of mommyblogs, May Friedman considers the ways that online maternal life writing provides a front row seat to some of the most raw, offbeat, and engaging portraits of motherhood imaginable. Focusing on the composition of the “mamasphere” and on mommyblogs’ emphasis on connection, Friedman reveals the changing face of contemporary motherhood – one less concerned with the proscriptions of what good mothers should do, and more invested in what diverse mothers have to say.","Right before the desserts started, it was decided that since we didn&#39;t have <br>\ntraditional games, that perhaps the two slaves should <b>diaper</b> each other and <br>\nserve des[s]ert in nothing but, in one case, a bow tie and a <b>diaper</b>, and in the <br>\nother,&nbsp;...",9781442665248,

BAKEFACE AND OTHER GUAVA STORIES is the fi rst title in Mango Publishing's new Classic Series, which will bring back into print tried and tested quality fi ction with an international reputation. This established collection is made up of four Jamaican stories: `Bake-Face', `Duppy Get Her', `Me Man Angel' and `Widow's Walk'. Adisa won the 1987 Pushcart Prize award for the short story, `Duppy Get Her'. An important thematic thread running through the stories is woman's relationship with self, woman's relationships with one another and with men, community, motherhood, hope, emptiness and power. Marginalised by both patriarchal and imperial structures, these women have, in effect, been victimised into a kind of voicelessness which Adisa subverts through her writing. In the stories, Adisa develops a new language to give voice to her women characters. Hers is a voice speaking from within the community, though the narrative is frequently focalised through the protagonist's consciousness. ""Solid, visceral, important stories written with integrity and love""--Alice Walker. Opal Palmer Adisa is a Jamaica-born novelist, poet, essayist, children's book author, visual artist, storyteller and teacher. Though she has lived in the United States since age 16, Adisa's work is rooted in Caribbean landscapes.","They chase her and she runs to and fro before standing her ground , lifting her <br>\ndress until her thighs are bared , confronting her competitor with the knowledge <br>\nthat she too has thighs , almond - stained and <b>diaper</b> - soft , which wrap <br>\nthemselves&nbsp;...",PSU:000063209167,

649,Sandy's Daily Diaries,101 Days of Social Distancing,Sandy Thomson,"In March 2020, when social distancing was brought into operation, a pensioner in a Scottish village began to write a daily blog on social media for family and friends. Sandy's wry and amusing descriptions of his day to day life quickly caught the imagination of readers worldwide, and became compulsive reading for more than 1600 followers. Sandy's diaries are filled with gentle humour and sharp observation. Here you will meet Sandy and his wife M, along with the rest of their family, and read about their interactions with each other, with friends and neighbours and with random people. There are encounters with birds and animals, airlines and insurance companies - some of it friendly, some less so - but always light hearted and thoroughly entertaining. As the diaries start, Sandy charts his daily activities, such as shopping and housework, and laments the downturn in his social life as events are cancelled. As the story progresses and lockdown becomes a reality we learn that M is isolated at home with Sandy and the interactions between her industrious nature and his relaxed outlook lead to some entertaining situations. Painting and decorating, gardening, DIY, all lend themselves to Sandy's sense of fun. And as we progress through the diaries, past the milestones of twenty, fifty, one hundred days, we meet more characters including El Gato the stray cat, Angry Dog and Percy the persistent crow. There are encounters with the Hoover from Hell, the garden shed of doom and the dreaded Times Crossword. All punctuated with regular supplies of scones from the Lovely Italian Neighbour. There are 101 of these daily diaries, and every one of them will make you smile. The Covid-19 pandemic was a devastating experience for many people and Sandy doesn't trivialise that, but he manages to find humour in the most ordinary of situations and to see the funny side of a very serious situation.",As the story progresses and lockdown becomes a reality we learn that M is isolated at home with Sandy and the interactions between her industrious nature and his relaxed outlook lead to some entertaining situations.,1838326804,Sandy's Daily Diaries 101 Days of Social Distancing
651,Mathematics of the Coronavirus Pandemic and Social Distancing,,James Glasman,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is having a devastating impact on world society medically, socially and economically. What light can the science of mathematics shed on how society and individuals deal with the coronavirus pandemic? In this illuminating book, biomathematician James Glasman proves that the current methods society is using to deal with the virus are insufficient to stop the spread of the virus and personal protective measures such as facemasks must be distributed to the general population, which must be required to be worn in public places. Glasman shows that the virulent and infectible spheres surrounding a person can be simply modeled using gaussian functions and that viral transmission likelihood can be calculated as the integral of the product of gaussians. He further shows that some but not all personal protective measures cause virulent spheres to contract. The book discusses in length the effects of social distancing on the speed of spread of the virus. The mathematical insights gained through this book lead to recommendations for personal protective measures for the general population. Lastly, the effects of immunity and vaccination on the course of the pandemic are discussed. Mathematics of the Coronavirus Pandemic and Social Distancing will prove to be an enlightening read and will spare many people from contracting the COVID-19 virus and will save many lives.",The book discusses in length the effects of social distancing on the speed of spread of the virus.

666,Representations of the social actor today,On policy of social distancing: A sociological analysis of the contemporary,Daniele Ungaro,"The book in question considers, in the essays that constitute it, the conditions of the contemporary social actor in the era of social distancing policies. In the first essay, an essential characteristic of the social actor, the existing tension between the rigidity of roles assumed and freedom of action is analyzed in the light of the practical and theoretical experiments carried out in the Commedia dell’Arte, as renewed by George and Maurice Sand, Goffman’s symbolic interactionism and Naranjo’s psychology of ennaeatypes. In the second essay, the studies carried out on the pseudo-social personality allow us to grasp an important aspect of the influence of social distancing policies on the contemporary social actor, the clear separation between survival strategies and communicative action, since in the era of the Covid 19 infection only the reduction of face-to-face relations seems to allow an adequate survival strategy. This implies the assumption of a prominent role by communication technologies, with psycho-social consequences that seem to go in the direction of a general increase of pseudo-sociality.","The book in question considers, in the essays that constitute it, the conditions of the contemporary social actor in the era of social distancing policies.",9788855263139,Representations of the social actor today On policy of social distancing: A sociological analysis of the contemporary

This creates opportunities for political parties to reach a wider potential audience or membership base. Digitalization has been an ongoing process in political parties across the globe, and the current pandemic is likely to accelerate this process. This Primer highlights some of the mechanisms that are being widely used and can be adopted by political parties to allow them to continue to function or operate in times of social distancing and other contexts where restrictions on social gatherings are being enforced. It also presents practical options for digitalization and developing an online presence that parties in different contexts can adapt and optimize to respond to such restrictions, and ideas to support the transformation efforts that parties are undertaking.","In several countries, political parties are stepping up their digital presence in the online world.",9789176713280,Adapting to the New Normal: Political Parties During Lockdown and Social Distancing Political Party Innovation Primer 6

For Felicity, with a new virus spreading in her community, she learns to focus on quality time with family, and appreciating what she has. Her parents provide her with a sense of hope for the future, compassion for those less fortunate and gratitude for those working to serve and protect us. Join Felicity in this playful and comforting tale as she learns to understand life in social isolation and how to cope during a challenging time. Felicity notices the quietness of her neighbourhood, and ponders why she cannot see her grandparents or friends. She learns about how valuable services, like garbage collection and recycling are, even during a crisis, while imagining the quirky robots who do some of the garbage sorting. The virus is explained in simple terms which children can easily understand. These new ""bugs"" are not to be feared, but the risk they pose to the community is key. This simple tale engenders compassion for those who are not so fortunate. It encourages us all to focus on being present, appreciating how fortunate she is to have time with family, and grateful to service providers and medical professionals working so hard to keep us all safe.

The optimal suppress strategy has low-infection rates, enabling assumptions that support closed-form solutions. The model predicts high costs of social distancing in comparison to health costs of the disease; it separates public versus private benefits of social distancing, and determines the required level of group immunity for relaxing social distance intervention. I extend the model with heterogeneous population for preferences over social contacts, health costs, and transmission. Heterogeneity in transmission intensity offers most opportunities for reduced costs under a differentiated social distancing policy.","I present a stylized suspected-infected-recovered (SIR) model of COVID-19, with symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients, and social distancing intervention.",OCLC:1190680022,

704,National and Sub-national Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,,Terrence W. Iverson,"This paper examines the effectiveness of sub-national actions to control a novel disease, such as COVID-19, in the absence of a national policy. Evidence is emerging that countries where subnational governments have undertaken unilateral social distancing measures to combat the pandemic with little or no coordination have performed less well in controlling the spread of the disease. We explore analytically whether agreement on a common social distancing policy among sub-national governments, i.e. states or provinces, can lead to a better outcome than if each state or province pursues its own social distancing policy in isolation. A key feature of our model is that it accounts for the inter-jurisdictional spillover effects of each sub-national jurisdiction's policy choice with respect to social distancing. Our results show that, in the absence of a national mandatory agreement, a sub-national agreement with sufficient coordination of social distancing policy among states yields a more effective and efficient control of a pandemic compared to states choosing policy unilaterally. These findings strongly support calls for greater cooperation among and assistance for sub-national governments to improve the effectiveness of their social distancing efforts in controlling the pandemic.","This paper examines the effectiveness of sub-national actions to control a novel disease, such as COVID-19, in the absence of a national policy.",OCLC:1195514548,

807,The Birth of Fascist Ideology,From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution,Zeev Sternhell,"When The Birth of Fascist Ideology was first published in 1989 in France and at the beginning of 1993 in Italy, it aroused a storm of response, positive and negative, to Zeev Sternhell's controversial interpretations. In Sternhell's view, fascism was much more than an episode in the history of Italy. He argues here that it possessed a coherent ideology with deep roots in European civilization. Long before fascism became a political force, he maintains, it was a major cultural phenomenon. This important book further asserts that although fascist ideology was grounded in a revolt against the Enlightenment, it was not a reactionary movement. It represented, instead, an ideological alternative to Marxism and liberalism and competed effectively with them by positing a revolt against modernity. Sternhell argues that the conceptual framework of fascism played an important role in its development. Building on radical nationalism and an ""antimaterialist"" revision of Marxism, fascism sought to destroy the existing political order and to uproot its theoretical and moral foundations. At the same time, its proponents wished to preserve all the achievements of modern technology and the advantages of the market economy. Nevertheless, fascism opposed every ""bourgeois"" value: universalism, humanism, progress, natural rights, and equality. Thus, as Sternhell shows, the fascists adopted the economic aspect of liberalism but completely denied its philosophical principles and the intellectual and moral heritage of modernity.","Ekelund , R.

1414,Peptide-carbohydrate Mimicry,Synthesis and Immunological Evaluation of Experimental Bacterial Vaccines,Bibi Rehana Hossany,"One of the most pressing global issues in human health today includes the need to develop new, safer, and more effective vaccines against the ever increasing range of emerging, re-emerging, and antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases. The discovery that peptides could mimic the structure of microbial polysaccharides in carbohydrate-specific immunological reactions, and hence have potential as surrogate vaccines, is emerging as a new paradigm in vaccine research and development to replace traditional carbohydrate vaccines against microbial infections. While the basis and origin of mimicry at the molecular level between these two chemically unrelated molecules (carbohydrate and peptide), but functionally equivalent molecular structures have been determined, the requirements for immunogenicity of these carbohydrate-mimetic peptides in raising a long-lasting, cross-reactive protective immune response against the original microbial polysaccharides are currently unknown. This knowledge is fundamental for the development of effective surrogate vaccines to target microbial surface carbohydrates. This thesis deals with the examination of the immunogenicity in mice of two carbohydrate-mimetic peptides, DRPVPY and MDWNMHAA, both identified from phage-displayed libraries, as mimics of the cell-surface polysaccharides of two pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus Group A and Shigella flexneri Y. As a crucial part of the studies, an efficient strategy has been developed to synthesize experimental vaccines comprising these two mimetic peptides, as well as a polysaccharide (ten repeating units) of Shigella flexneri Y. The results obtained from the immunogenicity studies provide insight into the requirements for immunologically cross-reactive mimics of carbohydrates, as well as demonstrate whether these two mimetic peptides could be used as surrogates in the development of vaccines against the two respective bacterial pathogens. Rational drug design, which is emerging as a powerful technique to improve upon initial discoveries, has been used in this thesis work to design a second generation of ligands for anti-carbohydrate antibodies, hopefully with much higher affinity. Two glycopeptides comprising features of both the original polysaccharide and the mimetic peptide have been designed by molecular modeling using information based on X-ray crystal structures of the two bound original ligands. Synthetic strategies have successfully been developed in this thesis work to synthesize the designed chimeric glycopeptides.",Synthetic strategies have successfully been developed in this thesis work to synthesize the designed chimeric glycopeptides.,OCLC:1125698194,Peptide-carbohydrate Mimicry Synthesis and Immunological Evaluation of Experimental Bacterial Vaccines

Efforts to develop a safe and effective tissue culture-derived vaccinia vaccine to replace the standard vaccine produced by scarification on cows' skin have advanced early clinical studies. It is generally accepted that protection induced by the conventional vaccinia vaccine correlated with cellular immune responses to live experimental and standard vaccinia vaccines. During the two years of this contract we have: (1) obtained, separated and cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 92 vaccinees in a clinical study to compare the standard and an experimental small pox vaccine, (2) prepared live and killed vaccinia virus antigens, (3) performed lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxic T cell assays and (4) performed immunoblot assays on vaccine donor samples. Both vaccines stimulated vaccinia virus-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in the vacinees, however, the standard smallpox vaccine stimulated significantly stronger immune responses through the traditional cutaneous route of inoculation.",The I purpose of this research program is to measure human cellular and humoral immune responses to live experimental and standard vaccinia vaccines.,OCLC:52497315,

1421,Developing an Experimental Vaccine Against Cryptosporidiosis Using an Attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium Delivery Vector,,Maxime Lemieux,"""Human cryptosporidiosis caused by Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum is an important disease causing severe diarrheal symptoms in infants and adults around the world. To date, no curative therapeutics or prophylactic vaccines against cryptosporidiosis exist. A recombinant Gp45 vaccine, developed in our laboratory, has shown to be partially protective against C.parvum in mice. However, to develop a more effective vaccine, we propose to use an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium model as an oral vaccine delivery vector for the Gp45 recombinant protein. We hypothesize that mucosal immunity, i.e. IgA levels, will be greater following the use of an oral YS1646 vaccine in addition to the intramuscular Gp45 vaccine in comparison with the intramuscular Gp45 vaccine alone. The overall goal of this M.Sc. was to produce various vaccine candidates against C.parvum, assess the expression of Gp45 of each candidate and evaluate the immunogenicity of our vaccine candidates in mice. Three constructs were constructed to express Gp45 in S. typhimurium and were transformed in an attenuated strain of S.typhimurium. We were successful in creating various plasmid constructs for expression of recombinant Gp45 in S.typhimurium. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in demonstrating expression of the recombinant Gp45 in any of our expression constructs. Despite failure to express Gp45 from Salmonella in vitro, two of our vaccine candidates were used in a preliminary study in mice. Following an IM/oral vaccination regimen and a 6-week study period, one of our vaccine candidates showed a statistically significant response compared to a negative control and no vaccine candidate produced greater serum IgG or intestinal IgA compared to a single dose of intramuscular Gp45. However, our YS1646 vaccine elicited a strong S.typhimurium specific serum IgG and intestinal IgA response suggesting the vaccine vector, and not the protein of interest, was the target of the murine immune system. Further optimization of our constructs is needed to obtain detectable levels of protein expression in vitro and enhance humoral immunity by our oral YS1646 vaccine in vivo. This investigation provides a first insight regarding the use of a vaccine vector against cryptosporidiosis."" --",&quot;Human cryptosporidiosis caused by Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum is an important disease causing severe diarrheal symptoms in infants and adults around the world.,OCLC:1112735170,
1422,AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF SIMULTANEOUS VACCINATION AGAINST TULAREMIA AND TUBERCULOSIS.,,,"The simultaneous cutaneous vaccination (separately or associated) against tularemia and tuberculosis creates a high immunity in guinea pigs against tularemia, and a specific resistance to subcutaneous infection with 1000 lethal doses of a virulent strain. Distinct immunological indices (allergic reaction and agglutination) in respect to tularemia were also noted in these pigs. In the animals which were inoculated simultaneous with the two vaccines, the local and general reactions were practically no different from the reactions in pigs which were inoculated with monovaccines. This demonstrates the harmlessness of combined vaccination. In guinea pigs which were vaccinated against tularemia and tuberculosis the immunity against tularemia was maintained over a period of 6 months (period of observation) to the same degree as in pigs which were inoculated with tularemia vaccine alone. The data obtained demonstrates the feasibility of the simultaneous vaccination against these two infections with the complete compatibility of the vaccines and a mild reactogenicity, which makes it possible to recommend that the appropriate testing of vaccination against tularemia and tuberculosis be carried out on humans.","The simultaneous cutaneous vaccination (separately or associated) against tularemia and tuberculosis creates a high immunity in guinea pigs against tularemia, and a specific resistance to subcutaneous infection with 1000 lethal doses of a ...",OCLC:227446068,

1425,Experimental Technique for Optimizing Aerosolized Vaccine Efficacy,,Erika Jaye Sandford,"Vaccination via aerosol has been proven to be as safe, as effective, and more appropriate for transportation when compared with vaccination via injection. These advantages make aerosolized vaccinations a realistic alternative to traditional injection vaccines for the developing world, where cold chain systems are impractical and the use of hypodermic needles can be unsafe. However, more research is needed to determine optimal parameters for vaccine aerosolization. This thesis presents an experimental setup to test Aerovax, a device designed to deliver aerosolized vaccinations in developing regions of the world. The experimental technique is the first effort to optimize vaccine aerosols across multiple variables, including input pressure, nebulizer geometry, and vaccine reconstitution. The setup provides a pressure input, sensors for ambient properties, and a device to measure particle size distribution.","Vaccination via aerosol has been proven to be as safe, as effective, and more appropriate for transportation when compared with vaccination via injection.",OCLC:676821708,

1435,Derivation of Tolerogenic Therapeutic Vaccines for Mouse Models of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis,,S. M. Touhidul Islam,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that results in autoimmune demyelination of the human central nervous system (CNS). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely-studied animal model of multiple sclerosis which reflects many of the histopathological and immunological features of MS. Because currently used therapies for multiple sclerosis result in broad-spectrum immunosuppression, antigen specific vaccines may be an important alternative. Whereas the concept of traditional anti-microbial vaccination is to introduce the immune system with the foreign microbes to develop memory T and B cells, self-reactive T cell suppression is the fundamental principle of tolerogenic vaccines. For EAE, contemporary research is focused on the development of potent tolerogens. Fusion proteins of cytokine and neuroantigen (NAg) are assumed to be such potent tolerogens. Antigen presenting cells (APC) are targeted by the fusion proteins in a cytokine dependent manner. These APC have been shown to play a fundamental role in inducing sustainable self-tolerance. That is, autoimmune effector T cells are eliminated by regulatory T (Treg) cells that are stimulated and expanded in a negative thymic selection process where dendritic cells (DC) play an inevitable role. The principle is that the cytokine domain of the fusion protein will interact with cytokine receptors on the APC and facilitate the presentation of covalently linked NAg to self reactive T cells and thereby, induce a co-inhibitory signal leading to cytotoxicity and killing of NAg-specific autoreactive T cells. In an approach to induce tolerogenic response in EAE, I have studied two fusion proteins consisting of interferon-beta (IFN-[beta]) fused to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and IFN-[beta] fused to proteolipid peptide (PLP). Both fusion proteins were potent tolerogens. The fusion genes were cloned in pIRES2 expression plasmids and then expressed stably in human embryonic kidney cells, and the fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography. Functional integrity of the IFN-[beta] domain within the fusion protein was confirmed by a T cell anti-proliferative assay and a class-I MHC induction assay. Biological activity of NAg domains were tested by NAg specific T cell proliferative assays. The tolerogenic effect of the fusion protein was assessed in two ways. First, the preventive role of IFN[beta]-PLP was examined by administering the protein before EAE induction which inhibited the subsequent incidence of EAE. Second, IFN[beta]-MOG was administered after disease onset which halted disease progression. In both cases, covalent linkage between the IFN-[beta] and NAg domain was required to restore the tolerance.",Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that results in autoimmune demyelination of the human central nervous system (CNS).,OCLC:794379246,
1438,Experimental Animal Models of HIV/AIDS for Vaccine Trials,,Bartholomew Okechukwu Ibeh,"AIDS still persists as a relevant disease in public health and scientific research. There have been significant advances in HIV research, notably the development of an effective regimen in antiretroviral therapy. However, the emergence of drug resistance has facilitated continued research in administration of therapy and the development of new antiretroviral drugs. In spite of nearly three (3) decades of intensive research, there still is not an effective vaccine against HIV-1. Animal models have been a crucial tool in drug discovery process for invasive investigation of HIV disease mainly in preclinical evaluation of drugs and vaccines. This undoubtedly is an integral part of successes so far achieved in HIV/AIDS research. Advances in both non-human primate and murine model immunogenetics in response to recombinant viruses have greatly increased the options of animal models available for research. Understanding the pros and cons of these models is imperative for animal study design that could further the development of vaccines and antiretroviral therapies for HIV prevention and treatment of AIDS patients.",AIDS still persists as a relevant disease in public health and scientific research.,OCLC:1154206870,
1443,Experimental and Applied Immunotherapy,,Jeffrey Medin,"Immunotherapy is now recognized as an essential component of treatment for a wide variety of cancers. It is an interdisciplinary field that is critically dependent upon an improved understanding of a vast network of cross-regulatory cellular populations and a diversity of molecular effectors; it is a leading example of translational medicine with a favorable concept-to-clinical-trial timeframe of just a few years. There are many established immunotherapies already in existence, but there are exciting new cancer immunotherapies just on the horizon, which are likely to be more potent, less toxic and more cost effective than many therapies currently in use. Experimental and Applied Immunotherapy is a state-of-the-art text offering a roadmap leading to the creation of these future cancer-fighting immunotherapies. It includes essays by leading researchers that cover a wide variety of topics including T cell and non-T cell therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, dendritic cell-based cancer vaccines, mesenchymal stromal cells, negative regulators in cancer immunology and immunotherapy, non-cellular aspects of cancer immunotherapy, the combining of cancer vaccines with conventional therapies, the combining of oncolytic viruses with cancer immunotherapy, transplantation, and more.

1446,Vaccines,,Peter Perlman,"The immune system is the only organ system in the body besides the central nervous systems endowed with memory. Both types of memories are specific and long-lasting, sometimes life long. This memory capacity of the immune system provides the basis for the most cost-efficient of all medical interventions, successful vaccinations against many common infectious diseases. Such a success requires the isolation of the infectious agent or toxic substance, methods to grow and/or purify the relevant antigen and change it into something innocuous whilst maintaining its immunogenicity. Whereas the early vaccines could only use the enhanced resistance against infectious disease as a measure of vaccine efficacy, most modern vaccines rely upon standardized laboratory tests accepted to parallel the in vivo protective capacity to confirm the quality and potency of the respective vaccine. We are presently experiencing an explosion in the development of new and/or improved vaccines. This is largely due to a parallel rapid expansion in our knowledge of the immune system and of the detailed molecular structure and function of microorganisms. Using this knowledge it is now possible to compose vaccines of new types where only certain molecules (or parts of molecules) derived from a pathogen are included, excluding other potentially harmful ones. Whereas earlier attenuated live vaccines were created by em pirical means such vaccines can now be created by molecularly defined inter ventions in the genome of the microorganism.",This is largely due to a parallel rapid expansion in our knowledge of the immune system and of the detailed molecular structure and function of microorganisms.,3540647406,

Although aerosolization is well understood, studies have focused on pharmaceuticals and very little data is available regarding vaccines. The proposed study analyzes the relationships between various pre- and post-aerosolization parameters in order to calculate the ""aerosol fingerprint,"" or combination of pre-aerosolization parameters optimized to produce the most effective aerosol particle size distribution for measles vaccination. Relevant pre-aerosolization parameters are identified as relative humidity, nebulizer temperature, vaccine reconstitution, solution pH, surface tension, viscosity, air pressure, and nebulizer geometry. Relevant post-aerosolization parameters are identified particle size distribution, aerosolization endurance and bioavailability, and drug delivery rate.

Protection was evident from: the healthy appearance throughout four months post-respiratory challenge; negative chest X-rays at 15, 30, 60, and 120 days; and only very minor histopathological pulmonary changes on autopsy at 120 days, with negative lung cultures in 80 per cent of the animals. This was in striking contrast to the outward clinical appearance of severe disease (loss of weight, accelerated respiration, severe coughing, general debilitation); positive X-rays; massive pulmonary destruction, positive lung cultures and death of five of nine of the monkeys that were un vaccinated or had received nonviable arthrospore vaccines. The appearance of spherules (very few in number, accompanied by very minor pathological changes) in the lungs of some of the dissemination controls (subcutaneous viable vaccination without respiratory challenge) indicated possible dissemination from the primary cutaneous infection, although oral transmission from the cutaneous lesions could not be ruled out.",Monkeys (Macaca mulatta) vaccinated by sub cutaneous injection in the forearm with from 10 to 10 to the 8th power viable Coccidioides immitis arthrospores were protected against respiratory challenge with approximately 7000 viable ...,OCLC:227317463,
1452,Pharmaceutical Biotechnology,,Carlos A. Guzmán,"Pharmaceutical Biotechnology is a unique compilation of reviews addressing frontiers in biologicals as a rich source for innovative medicines. This book fulfills the needs of a broad community of scientists interested in biologicals from diverse perspectives—basic research, biotechnology, protein engineering, protein delivery, medicines, pharmaceuticals and vaccinology. The diverse topics range from advanced biotechnologies aimed to introduce novel, potent engineered vaccines of unprecedented efficacy and safety for a wide scope of human diseases to natural products, small peptides and polypeptides engineered for discrete prophylaxis and therapeutic purposes. Modern biologicals promise to dramatically expand the scope of preventive medicine beyond the infectious disease arena into broad applications in immune and cancer treatment, as exemplified by anti-EGFR receptors antibodies for the treatment of breast cancer. The exponential growth in biologicals such as engineered proteins and vaccines has been boosted by unprecedented scientific breakthroughs made in the past decades culminating in an in-depth fundamental understanding of the scientific underpinnings of immune mechanisms together with knowledge of protein and peptide scaffolds that can be deliberately manipulated. This has in turn led to new strategies and processes. Deciphering the human, mammalian and numerous pathogens’ genomes provides opportunities that never before have been available—identification of discrete antigens (genomes and antigenomes) that lend themselves to considerably improved antigens and monoclonal antibodies, which with more sophisticated engineered adjuvants and agonists of pattern recognition receptors present in immune cells, deliver unprecedented safety and efficacy. Technological development such a nanobiotechnologies (dendrimers, nanobodies and fullerenes), biological particles (viral-like particles and bacterial ghosts) and innovative vectors (replication-competent attenuated, replication-incompetent recombinant and defective helper-dependent vectors) fulfill a broad range of cutting-edge research, drug discovery and delivery applications. Most recent examples of breakthrough biologicals include the human papilloma virus vaccine (HPV, prevention of women genital cancer) and the multivalent Pneumoccocal vaccines, which has virtually eradicated in some populations a most prevalent bacterial ear infection (i.e., otitis media). It is expected that in the years to come similar success will be obtained in the development of vaccines for diseases which still represent major threats for human health, such as AIDS, as well as for the generation of improved vaccines against diseases like pandemic flu for which vaccines are currently available. Furthermore, advances in comparative immunology and innate immunity revealed opportunities for innovative strategies for ever smaller biologicals and vaccines derived from species such as llama and sharks, which carry tremendous potential for innovative biologicals already in development stages in many pharmaceutical companies. Such recent discoveries and knowledge exploitations hold the promise for breakthrough biologicals, with the coming decade. Finally, this book caters to individuals not directly engaged in the pharmaceutical drug discovery process via a chapter outlining discovery, preclinical development, clinical development and translational medicine issues that are critical the drug development process. The authors and editors hope that this compilation of reviews will help readers rapidly and completely update knowledge and understanding of the frontiers in pharmaceutical biotechnologies.","This book fulfills the needs of a broad community of scientists interested in biologicals from diverse perspectives—basic research, biotechnology, protein engineering, protein delivery, medicines, pharmaceuticals and vaccinology.",1441911316,

It's also more dangerous for those who have chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, weakened immune systems and other underlying health issues.And yet our news feeds are full of stories about seemingly healthy young people who are quickly struck down.These tragic deaths seem all the more confounding when you consider a flurry of new scientific studies that suggest as many as 20% of people who are infected with the Chinese Virus -- and possibly many more -- never develop any symptoms.This lucky group is spared the dry cough, fever and body aches we now associate with Chinese Virus, even while the virus proliferates in their bodies and potentially spreads to others.This new understanding about the role of ""silent spreaders"" is why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities are now suggesting that people wear masks when they leave the house. The recommendation is primarily designed to keep asymptomatic people from unwittingly spreading a disease they may not even know they have.But how can the same virus affect people so differently -- killing some while leaving others blissfully unaware that they have been infected at all?...",We know Chinese Virus is more deadly the older you get.,9798639863028,"Immune System How to Boost Your Immune System, Amid Chinese Virus Pandemic"
1833,Avian Reservoirs,Virus Hunters and Birdwatchers in Chinese Sentinel Posts,Frédéric Keck,"After experiencing the SARS outbreak in 2003, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan all invested in various techniques to mitigate future pandemics involving myriad cross-species interactions between humans and birds. In some locations microbiologists allied with veterinarians and birdwatchers to follow the mutations of flu viruses in birds and humans and create preparedness strategies, while in others, public health officials worked toward preventing pandemics by killing thousands of birds. In Avian Reservoirs Frédéric Keck offers a comparative analysis of these responses, tracing how the anticipation of bird flu pandemics has changed relations between birds and humans in China. Drawing on anthropological theory and ethnographic fieldwork, Keck demonstrates that varied strategies dealing with the threat of pandemics—stockpiling vaccines and samples in Taiwan, simulating pandemics in Singapore, and monitoring viruses and disease vectors in Hong Kong—reflect local geopolitical relations to mainland China. In outlining how interactions among pathogens, birds, and humans shape the way people imagine future pandemics, Keck illuminates how interspecies relations are crucial for protecting against such threats.","In Avian Reservoirs Frédéric Keck offers a comparative analysis of these responses, tracing how the anticipation of bird flu pandemics has changed relations between birds and humans in China.",9781478007555,Avian Reservoirs Virus Hunters and Birdwatchers in Chinese Sentinel Posts

In a study of 146 Chinese HBV patients, mannose binding lectin mutation was associated with increased chance of cirrhotic complications. The most important factor for the development of cirrhotic complications in a study of 3433 Chinese HBV patients was increasing age. The median age of development of cirrhotic complications was 55 60 years old. Though HBeAg seroconversion led to a low viraemic state, 60 - 70% of patients who had cirrhotic complications were anti-HBe positive. HBeAg seroconversion did not protect Chinese patients from the development of cirrhotic complications. IFN-a treatment improves prognosis in Caucasian HBV patients. But, a nine-year follow-up study involving 411 Chinese patients showed that IFN-a treatment did not increase cumulative HBeAg seroconversion rate and more importantly, did not decrease cirrhotic complication. Prolonged lamivudine treatment is associated with the emergence of YMDD variants. The factors associated with HBV DNA breakthrough were examined in 159 patients. Patients with higher baseline HBV DNA and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were associated with earlier YMDD variants development. Patients with HBV DNA levels> 103 copies/ml at 6 months of therapy had 63% chance of developing YMDD variant within 29 months of follow-up. Patients with YMDD variants could still develop HBeAg seroconversion.

It presents a remarkable opportunity to understand his personal history, the development of his scholarly qualities, and the logic of his scientific and cultural passions. A leader in the field over the past half a century, the author was a pioneer investigator of interferon. He made major contributions to the pathogenesis of virus infections in the immunocompromised host, especially of cytomegalovirus and other herpesvirus infections in organ transplant recipients. He built a strong science-based infectious diseases group at the University of Pittsburgh in the US. In his “second career” in Taiwan, Monto Ho changed the direction of his research to address problems that were important to that country. He recognized the threat posed by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the need to enhance the quality of training of infectious diseases physicians. These efforts paid unexpected dividends. The appropriate use of antibiotics has become an important national health priority, and there is now intense research on the devastating outbreaks of enterovirus 71 in children.

Up to 10% of the general population may carry risk alleles for developing Cytokine Storm Syndromes, and Cytokine Storm Syndromes are being increasingly recognized around the world in pediatric and adult hospitals. A variety of infectious, rheumatic, and oncologic triggers are commonly associated with Cytokine Storm Syndromes, but understanding this disorder is critical for all researchers and physicians to ensure timely and appropriate therapy. This textbook, the first of its kind, addresses all aspects of the disorder – from genetics, pathophysiology, and ongoing research, to clinical presentations, risk factors, and treatment.",These are being studied using murine models.,9783030220945,
2512,What is “Cytokine Storm”? Understanding its Role in the Pathology of Clinical & Infectious Disease at Molecular Level.,,Dr. Hakim. K. Saboowala.,"What is “Cytokine Storm”? Understanding its Role in the Pathology of Clinical & Infectious Disease at Molecular Level. The term “Cytokine Storm” was popularized largely in the context of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection, bringing the term into popular media. The cytokine storm has captured the attention of the public and the scientific community alike, and while the general notion of an excessive or uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines is well known, the concept of a cytokine storm and the biological consequences of cytokine overproduction are not clearly defined. Cytokine storms are associated with a wide variety of infectious and noninfectious diseases. In this E-Booklet an effort has been made to focus on the cytokine storm in the context of virus infection, and to highlight how high-throughput genomic methods are revealing the importance of the kinetics of cytokine gene expression and the remarkable degree of redundancy and overlap in cytokine signaling. Further, it is also attempted to address evidence for and against the role of the cytokine storm in the pathology of clinical and infectious disease and discuss why it has been so difficult to use knowledge of the cytokine storm and immunomodulatory therapies to improve the clinical outcomes for patients with severe acute infections. …Dr. H.

3230,Behind The Mask (My Journey),Entrepreneurs: Creating Legacies While Embracing Our Journeys,Jerwanda Johnson,"The journey has been defined as an act of traveling from one place to another. It's a natural thing that occurs as we learn, grow, depart and serve. We take a step, perhaps stop. We look around us, we encounter detours. We start again....a little success, a lot of failures. What will it take to move us to ""there""? Is ""there"" even real? We are sure that one thing that we all can agree upon is that this path is not an easy one. Bumps, potholes, and curves can oftentimes cause us to pull over, stop and take a breather. However, this is the time when we must stick to the map the most. This is the inner compass that will lead us intrinsically towards our best selves. The journey that we all speak of in this book, is one towards nurse entrepreneurship. Yes, we are Nurses, yes we enjoy patient care and teaching others about health. However, along the journeys described in this anthology, we discovered more. We discovered our how what and who we are. What we have created in this book was formed to inspire nurses, future nurses and women everywhere to not give up when hard times come. These nurses have endured some hard times, tough situations and unbelievable circumstances. At the end of it all, they endured their journey towards their version of success, meaning, and entrepreneurship. This anthology serves to share the triumphs and victories and the fulfillment of achieving a successful arrival towards a destination. We pray that you can get excited about your own journey, use us as your backseat driver, and put the pedal to the metal while you coast along. Take heed, be cautious, but never stop. We look forward to seeing you ""there""! Share this book with your favorite nurse, relative or friend and encourage them to continue onward along their JOURNEY.","However, this is the time when we must stick to the map the most.
