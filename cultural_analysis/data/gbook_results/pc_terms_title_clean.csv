2,The Gendered Society Reader,,Michael S. Kimmel,"The battle between the sexes has raged on for centuries; however, are men and women really from different planets? In The Gendered Society Reader, Fourth Edition, coeditors Michael Kimmel and Amy Aronson pull together an array of dynamic voices--both male and female, classic and contemporary--to examine various interpretations of gender. These lively, in-depth readings explore gender discourse over a wide range of disciplines, focusing primarily on two central issues: difference and domination. Carefully balanced to reflect the diversity of its subject, this text addresses provocative and fundamental questions including: * How are males and females different? * What do these differences mean? * How do various cultures and religions interpret gender? * Why do societies continue to differentiate people on the basis of gender? * Why is it that almost every known society is based on male domination? This reader mirrors the intuitive structure of Kimmel's companion volume, The Gendered Society, Fourth Edition. The first sections are arranged by discipline, presenting analyses of theoretical perspectives and research inquiries. The final sections examine the often fraught relationships between gender and education, the workplace, the media, the body, the family, love, sex, and violence. The celebrated contributors include Peggy Reeves Sanday, Judith Lorber, Robert M. Sapolsky, Scott Coltrane, and many more. Thoroughly updated with rich and timely new material, the fourth edition features twenty-one new selections, including three essays in a new section on religion, four new selections on gender and the media, and a new article on non-heterosexual families. This edition is also supplemented by an Instructor's Manual/Test Bank, which includes discussion questions.

3,The Gendered Object,,Pat Kirkham,"From Barbie and Action Man to guns via bicycles, perfume and trainers, The gendered object is an intriguing collection of new writing on the way in which objects of everyday life are made socially acceptable and 'appropriate' for women or men. What does the Strawberry Shortcake doll tell us about views of the adult female body? When does the necktie become anti-establishment? How does a woman relate to a washing machine? And can a hearing aid really be gendered? These questions are answered and many others raised in this entertaining study of design for men and women.",0719044758,
5,Women in the Crucible of Conquest,"The Gendered Genesis of Spanish American Society, 1500-1600",Karen Vieira Powers,"The evidence of women in the Americas is conspicuously absent from most historical syntheses of the Spanish invasion and early colonization of the New World. Karen Powers's ethnohistoric account is the first to focus on non-military incidents during this transformative period. As she shows, native women's lives were changed dramatically. Women in the Crucible of Conquestuncovers the activities and experiences of women, shows how the intersection of gender, race, and class shaped their lives, and reveals the sometimes hidden ways they were integrated into social institutions. Powers's premise is that women were demoted in status across race and class and that some women resisted this trend. She describes the ways women made spaces for themselves in colonial society, in the economy, and in convents as well as other religious arenas, such as witchcraft. She shows how violence and intimidation were used to control women and writes about the place of sexual relations, especially miscegenation, in the forging of colonial social and economic structures. From Karen Vieira Powers's Introduction: ""During the colonization process, indigenous women suffered, perhaps, the most precipitous decline in status of any group of colonial women. For this reason, and because they were numerically superior to all other women, I have chosen to make them the heart of this book. Nevertheless, the work also treats Spanish women, racially mixed women (mestizas, mulattas, zambas, etc.), and African women.""",0826335195,"Women in the Crucible of Conquest The Gendered Genesis of Spanish American Society, 1500-1600"
7,The Gendered Society,,Michael S. Kimmel,"Thoroughly updated and revised, the third edition of The Gendered Society explores current thinking about gender, both inside academia and in our everyday lives. Michael S. Kimmel challenges the claim that gender is limited to women's experiences--his compelling and balanced study of gender includes both masculine and feminine perspectives. Part 1 examines the latest work in biology, anthropology, psychology, and sociology; Part 2 provides an original analysis of the gendered worlds of family, education, and work; and Part 3 explores gender interactions, including friendship and love, sexuality, and violence. Kimmel makes three bold and persuasive statements about gender. First, he demonstrates that gender differences are often extremely exaggerated; in fact, he argues that men and women have much more in common than we think they do. Kimmel also challenges the pop psychologists who suggest that gender difference is the cause of inequality between the sexes; instead, he reveals that the reverse is true--gender inequality itself is the cause of the differences between men and women. Finally, he illustrates that gender is not merely an element of individual identity, but a socially constructed institutional phenomenon. A new chapter on media examines the portrayal of gender in one of the most powerful--and provocative--social institutions. Of particular interest to students, Kimmel's analysis of this dynamic, image-driven industry makes the study of gender relevant in an immediate and tangible way. Essential reading for both students and scholars, The Gendered Society is an authoritative, incisive, and lively statement about contemporary gender relations from one of the country's foremost thinkers on the subject. Kimmel's companion text,The Gendered Society Reader, Third Edition (OUP, 2008), provides a perfect complement for classroom use.",UOM:39015079163773,

12,Gendered Mobilities,,Mr Tanu Priya Uteng,"Being socially and geographically mobile is generally seen as one of the central aspects of women's wellbeing. Alongside health, education and political participation, mobility is indispensable in order for women to reach goals such as agency and freedom. Building on new philosophical underpinnings of 'mobility', whereby society is seen to be framed by the convergence of various mobilities, this volume focuses on the intersection of mobility, social justice and gender. The authors reflect on five highly interdependent mobilities that form and reform social life: ∗ The origin, divisions and implication of physical travel for work, leisure, family life, migration and escape. ∗ Physical movement of goods and their gendered impacts. ∗ The gendered content of imagined travel through televisual images. ∗ Virtual travel via the Internet. ∗ Communicative travel through person-to-person messages via letters, telephone, fax and mobile phone. This volume covers an entire range of social, cultural, religious, economic, ethnic and political factors and processes.",9781409487623,
16,Gendered Words,Sentiments and Expression in Changing Rural China,Fei-wen Liu,"Built on twenty years of fieldwork in rural Jiangyong of Hunan Province in south China, this book explores the world's only gender-defined and now disappearing ""women's script"" known as nüshu. What drove peasant women to create a script of their own and write, and how do those writings throw new light on how gender is addressed in epistemology and historiography and how the unprivileged social class uses marginalized forms of expression to negotiate with the dominant social structure. Further, how have the politics of salvaging this disappearing centuries-old cultural heritage molded a new poetics in contemporary society? This book explores nüshu in conjunction with the local women's singing tradition (nüge), tied into the life narratives of four women born in the 1910s, 1930s, and 1960s respectively, each representative in her own way: a nüge singer (majority of Jiangyong women), a child bride (enjoying not much nüshu/nüge), the last living traditionally-trained nüshu writer, and a new-generation nüshu transmitter. Altogether, their stories unfold peasant women's lifeworlds and forefronts various aspects of China's changing social milieu over the past century. They show how nüshu/nüge-registering women's sense and sensibilities and providing agency to subjects who have been silenced by history-constitute a reflexive social field whereby women share life stories to expand the horizon of their personal worldviews and probe beneath the surface of their existence for new inspiration in their process of becoming. With the concept of ""expressive depths,"" this book opens a new vista on how women express themselves through multiple forms that simultaneously echo and critique the mainstream social system and urges a rethinking of how forms of expression define and confine the voice carried. Examining the multiple efforts undertaken by scholars, local officials, and cultural entrepreneurs to revive nüshu which have ironically threatened to disfigure its true face, this book poses a question of whither nüshu? Should it be transformed, or has it reached a perfect end point from which to fade into history?",9780190272913,Gendered Words Sentiments and Expression in Changing Rural China

22,Gendered Bodies,Feminist Perspectives,Judith Lorber,"For centuries the biological sciences have dissected, measured, and probed the human body as a product of nature. But from a feminist perspective, the human body is a social production. Human bodies are shaped and controlled by the norms and expectations of gendered social orders, intersected by racial, class, religious, and age norms and expectations. The result is a gendered body produced for a gendered social world. In this concise text with readings, designed for undergraduate students, Lorber and Moore present feminist contributions to social and cultural studies of the human body, showing the construction of gendered bodies in different contexts. The authors argue that the ideology of the perfect body is a powerful means of social control for girls and boys as well as women and men. The authors show how children's bodies are gendered through games and sports - and shaped and modified throughout adulthood to meet social expectations. Each chapter includes a list of key concepts, three readings, recommended books and articles, and Internet sources. For the instructor, the book includes class exercises and a list of films with somatic themes.",STANFORD:36105122850394,Gendered Bodies Feminist Perspectives

Hundreds more schools are contemplating separate classes for boys and girls in the wake of the 2006 legislation that allows such programmes to satisfy Title IX requirements. Spearheading the national trend in this direction with over 300 single-gender programmes is South Carolina, where David W. Chadwell was appointed the first state coordinator for single-gender initiatives. In this book, Chadwell lays out for administrators the step-by-step process of implementing single-sex programmes and schools in three stages: designing, initiating, and sustaining. A Gendered Choice is a practical, how-to book based upon unique, first-hand experience that interested administrators will want to examine as they contemplate or begin to introduce single-gender programmes in their schools.",9781412972598,A Gendered Choice Designing and Implementing Single-Sex Programs and Schools
33,Gendered Practices in Working Life,,Tuula Heiskanen,"Gendered distinctions and differences in working life are produced by often hidden practices. What are they like? How do they work? The book creates, through its multidisciplinary approach and rich empirical data, a wide perspective on gendered practices in working life, from the level of labour market structures to the personal experiences of women and men. Some taken-for-granted assumptions of gender in social sciences and feminist research are challenged by a view through the 'Nordic window'.",9781349252855,
35,Gendered Compromises,"Political Cultures and the State in Chile, 1920-1950",Karin Alejandra Rosemblatt,"With this book, Karin Rosemblatt presents a gendered history of the politics and political compromise that emerged in Chile during the 1930s and 1940s, when reformist popular-front coalitions held power. While other scholars have focused on the economic realignments and novel political pacts that characterized Chilean politics during this era, Rosemblatt explores how gender helped shape Chile's evolving national identity. Rosemblatt examines how and why the aims of feminists, socialists, labor activists, social workers, physicians, and political leaders converged around a shared gender ideology. Tracing the complex negotiations surrounding the implementation of new labor, health, and welfare policies, she shows that professionals in health and welfare agencies sought to regulate gender and sexuality within the working class and to consolidate the male-led nuclear family as the basis of societal stability. Leftists collaborated in these efforts because they felt that strong family bonds would generate a sense of class belonging and help unify the Left, while feminists perceived male familial responsibility as beneficial for women. Diverse actors within civil society thus reworked the norms of masculinity and femininity developed by state agencies and political leaders_even as others challenged those ideals.",0807848816,"Gendered Compromises Political Cultures and the State in Chile, 1920-1950"

But what does this mean for our thoughts, decisions and behaviour?

Do gardeners make aesthetic choices according to how they are positioned by class and gender? This book presents the first scholarly analysis of the relationship between media interest in gardening and cultural identities. With an examination of aesthetic dispositions as a symbolic mode of communication closely aligned to peoples' identities and drawing on ethnographic data gathered from encounters with gardeners, this book maps a typology of gardening taste, revealing that gardening - how plants are chosen, planted and cared for - is a classed and gendered practice manifested in specific types of visual aesthetics. This timely and original book develops a new area within cultural studies while contributing to debates about lifestyle and lifestyle media, consumption, class and methodology.

44,"Femininity, Feminism and Gendered Discourse",A Selected and Edited Collection of Papers from the Fifth International Language and Gender Association Conference (IGALA5),Janet Holmes,"The chapters in this book illustrate a range of cutting edge research in language and gender studies, with contributions from a number of internationally recognised experts. The three themes, femininity, feminism and gendered discourse are central to research in language and gender, and the book thus makes a valuable contribution to a number of current debates. Femininity comprises a central aspect of gender performance and the process of “gendering” individuals is on-going and unavoidable. For many people, the word “femininity” has associations with “frilly pink party dresses,” with demureness, deference, and lack of power and influence. The first section of this book demonstrates some alternative conceptions of femininity, and a range of ways in which femininity is performed in different contexts and cultures. The analyses illustrate that we are all continually performing aspects of femininity (and masculinity) in flexible, dynamic, ambiguous, predictable and unpredictable ways. Language and gender research has a long tradition of engagement with the political, and specifically with feminism and feminist goals. The chapters in the second section of this book demonstrate the value of identifying gendered patterns in order to challenge their potentially repressive effects in social interaction in a range of spheres. The researchers analyse contemporary international evidence of sexism in language use, including material from Japanese spam emails expressing sexual desire, and from media reporting on male and female candidates in the 2007 French elections. The final section of this book focuses on the different ways in which we negotiate our gender through discourse. Gender is just one of many facets of our intrinsically hybridized social identities. Nevertheless, it is a very significant facet, a salient dimension in everyday life, with a pervasive social influence on everything we do and say. Interaction is typically viewed through “gendered” spectacles much of the time. The chapters in the third section focus in detail on diverse ways in which gender is constructed through discourse, examining the interaction between individual agency and the larger constraining social structures, including socio-cultural norms, within which that agency is enacted. Finally, the different contributions in this book represent research from a multiplicity of geographic and cultural backgrounds, supporting efforts to internationalise language and gender research, and to raise awareness of empirical studies undertaken in a wide range of linguistic and cultural contexts.",9781443824378,"Femininity, Feminism and Gendered Discourse A Selected and Edited Collection of Papers from the Fifth International Language and Gender Association Conference (IGALA5)"

48,Women and Planning,Creating Gendered Realities,Clara H. Greed,"Planning is currently a male profession, but an analysis of a century of town planning reveals this to be a new development; women have been central to the planning movement since it began. Women and Planning is the first comprehensive history and analysis of women and the planning movement, covering the philosophical, practical and policy dimensions of `planning for women'. Beyond the marginalization of women, modern, scientific planning hides a story of past links with eugenics, colonialism, artistic, utopian and religious movements and the occult. Central to the discussion is the questioning of how male planners have rewritten planning in their own image, projecting patriarchal assumptions in their creation of `urban realities'. Issues of class, sexuality, ethnicity and disability are raised by the fundamental question of `Who is being planned for?'",9781134895960,Women and Planning Creating Gendered Realities

52,Counterbalance,Gendered Perspectives on Writing and Language,Carolyn Logan,"Like other composition readers, Counterbalance has as its primary purpose to improve thinking, reading and writing skills, recognizing throughout the degree to which these are inextricably interlinked. Where Counterbalance differs from almost all other composition readers is in the prominence it gives to writing by women. More and more of the writers in modern Western society are women and women now comprise a substantial majority of the students in many undergraduate courses. Yet most texts are eighty per cent or more comprised of writing by men. As its title suggests, this book acts as a counterbalance; over three-quarters of the essays are by women. The feminist stance of Counterbalance is unequivocal; an important aim of this text is to encourage students to question assumptions about gender. But for those to whom the word ‘feminist’ engenders immediate unease, it should be emphasised that the stance of the text is provocative and open-minded rather than strident or exclusionary; Audre Lorde and bell hooks are here, but so is George Orwell. The text is also designed as a counterbalance in other respects; many of the essays here explore issues of race, culture and class. Notions of correctness and issues of free speech and responsibility are also treated. As a whole the book is thus an invigorating and enormously wide-ranging spur to thought and discussion. Yet it avoids the scatter-gun approach so common to first-year collections; Counterbalance retains throughout a focus on language—perhaps the one area that all students, no matter what their backgrounds and interests, can connect to out of their everyday experience. The book’s thesis is that we can all think more clearly and use language more effectively if we know not only something about the traditional areas of composition and grammar but also something about how language influences us. The essays selected demonstrate a variety of expository styles, organizations and methods of development. They are organized into seven chapters so as to present a coherent progression, moving from simpler essays on more familiar topics to more difficult concepts and writing assignments.",1551111276,Counterbalance Gendered Perspectives on Writing and Language

It combines a wide sweep with focused analysis of gender dynamics at home and at work, and the interaction between them. A longitudinal and life course perspective underpins the authors' assessment of the current state of gender inequality, and helps explain why some domains are more resistant to change than others. This timely and innovative volume will be an excellent resource for academics and policy-makers alike.' – Miriam Glucksmann, University of Essex, UK This meticulous book examines how gender inequalities in contemporary societies are changing and how further changes towards greater gender equality might be achieved. The focus of the book is on inequalities in production and reproductive activities, as played out over time and in specific contexts. It examines the different forms that gendered lives take in the household and the workplace, and explores how gender equalities may be promoted in a changing world. Gendered Lives offers many novel and sometimes unexpected findings that contribute to new understandings of not only the causes of gender inequalities, but also the ongoing implications for economic well-being and societal integration. This topical and interdisciplinary study by leading researchers in the field will appeal to course leaders, researchers and postgraduate students in sociology, economics, public policy, demography and human geography. Social scientists interested in gender equality, labour market behaviour and public policy will also find much to interest them in this fascinating book.",9781849806275,Gendered Lives Gender Inequalities in Production and Reproduction

This collection focuses specifically on the goals relating to gender issues that are problematic for women. The most relevant and contentious is that of promoting gender equality and empowering women. The book provides an overview of this and investigates literature that considers how gender is central to achieving the other goals. The contributors distinctively consider gender in the context of human security (or insecurity); the reduction and elimination of conflict would seem to be central to achieving targets. One of the major themes of this collection is whether gender insecurity has been exacerbated in an increasingly insecure world. The book considers not only military and civilian conflict in the contemporary era but also security in the broader sense of human development, such as environmental, reproductive and economic security.",9781409499459,Development in an Insecure and Gendered World The Relevance of the Millennium Goals

Gendered Mediation takes an original approach to the study of gender and political communication by examining the implications of intersecting notions of gender, sexuality, race, age, and class deployed by politicians, journalists, and citizens in Canadian politics. Building upon the gendered mediation thesis, leading scholars argue that political communication and reporting still reinforces impressions of politics as a masculine domain. Their findings have profound implications for democracy not only in Canada but also for democratic political systems elsewhere.",9780774860581,Gendered Mediation Identity and Image Making in Canadian Politics
62,Female Mobility and Gendered Space in Ancient Greek Myth,,Ariadne Konstantinou,"Women's mobility is central to understanding cultural constructions of gender. Regarding ancient cultures, including ancient Greece, a re-evaluation of women's mobility within the household and beyond it is currently taking place. This invites an informed analysis of female mobility in Greek myth, under the premise that myth may open a venue to social ideology and the imaginary. Female Mobility and Gendered Space in Ancient Greek Myth offers the first comprehensive analysis of this topic. It presents close readings of ancient texts, engaging with feminist thought and the 'mobility turn'. A variety of Olympian goddesses and mortal heroines are explored, and the analysis of their myths follows specific chronological considerations. Female mobility is presented in quite diverse ways in myth, reflecting cultural flexibility in imagining mobile goddesses and heroines. At the same time, the out-of-doors spaces that mortal heroines inhabit seem to lack a public or civic quality, with the heroines being contained behind 'glass walls'. In this respect, myth seems to reproduce the cultural limitations of ancient Greek social ideology on mobility, inviting us to reflect not only on the limits of mythic imagination but also on the timelessness of Greek myth.",9781474256773,

It explores the ingenious and, at times, painful ways in which French-Canadian women, men, and children adjusted to the challenges of moving to, and settling in, that industrial city. Yukari Takai uncovers the multitude of cross-border journeys of Lowell-bound French Canadians, the centrality of their family networks, and the ways in which the ideology of the family wage and the socioeconomic realities in Québec and New England shaped migrants' lives on both sides of the border. Takai argues that French-Canadian husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters harboured complex interpersonal dynamics whereby differing and, at times, conflicting interests had to be negotiated in not necessarily equal terms, but in accordance with each member's power and authority within the family and, by extension, larger society. Drawing on extensive historical research including archival records, collections of oral histories, newspapers, and contemporary observations in both English and French, Gendered Passages contributes to the re-reading of French-Canadian migration, which constitutes a fundamental part of North American history.",STANFORD:36105131739216,"Gendered Passages French-Canadian Migration to Lowell, Massachusetts, 1900-1920"

Case studies of specific films provide textual and musical analyses, and the genres of melodrama and the woman's film have been chosen as representative not only of the epitome of the Hollywood scoring style, but also of the narrative association of women, emotion and music.

69,Revisiting Gendered States,Feminist Imaginings of the State in International Relations,Swati Parashar,"Two decades ago, V. Spike Peterson's Gendered States asked what difference gender makes in international relations and the construction of the sovereign state system. This book connects the earlier debates of Peterson's book with the gendered state today, one that exists within a globalized and increasingly securitized world. Bringing together an international group of contributors from the Global South, United States, Europe, and Australia, this volume answers three overarching questions. First, it answers whether the concept of a ""gendered state"" is generic or if some states are particularly gendered in their identities and interests, and with what implications for the type of citizenship, society, and international security. Second, it looks at the continued theoretical significance of the gendered state for current IR scholarship. And, finally, it explains to what extent postcolonial states are distinctive from metropolitan states with regard to gender. Including scholars from International Relations, Postcolonial Studies, and Development Studies, this volume collectively theorizes the modern state and its intricate relationship to security, identity politics, and gender.

83,Equity Stirring,The Story of Justice Beyond Law,Gary Watt,"Sir Frederick Pollock wrote that 'English-speaking lawyers ...have specialised the name of Equity'. It is typical for legal textbooks on the law of equity to acknowledge the diverse ways in which the word 'equity' is used and then to focus on the legal sense of the word to the exclusion of all others. There may be a professional responsibility on textbook writers to do just that. If so, there is a counterpart responsibility to read the law imaginatively and to read what non-lawyers have said of equity with an open mind. This book is an exploration of the meaning of equity as artists and thinkers have portrayed it within the law and without. Watt finds in law and literature an equity that is necessary to good life and good law but which does not require us to subscribe to a moral or 'natural law' ideal. It is an equity that takes a principled and practical stand against rigid formalism and unthinking routine in law and life, and so provides timely resistance to current forces of extremism and entitlement culture. The project is an educational one in the true etymological sense of leading the reader out into new territory. The book will provide the legal scholar with deep insight into the rhetorical, literary and historical foundations of the idea of equity in law, and it will provide the law student with a cultural history of, and an imaginative introduction to, the technical law of equity and trusts. Scholars and students of such disciplines as literature, classics, history, theology, theatre and rhetoric will discover new insights into the art of equity in the law and beyond. Along the way, Watt offers a new theory on the naming of Dickens' chancery case Jarndyce and Jarndyce and suggests a new connection between Shakespeare and the origin of equity in modern law. 'This beautiful book, deeply learned in the branch of jurisprudence we call equity and deeply engaged with the western literary tradition, gives new life to equity in the legal sense by connecting it with equity in the larger sense: as it is defined both in ordinary language and experience and by great writers, especially Dickens and Shakespeare. Equity Stirring transforms our sense of what equity is and can be and demonstrates in a new and graceful way the importance of connecting law with other arts of mind and language.' James Boyd White, author of Living Speech: Resisting the Empire of Force 'Equity Stirring' is a fine example of interdisciplinary legal scholarship at its best. Watt has managed to produce a book that is fresh and innovative, and thoroughly accessible. Deploying a range of familiar, and not so familiar, texts from across the humanities, Watt has presented a fascinating historical and literary commentary on the evolution of modern ideas of justice and equity. Ian Ward, Professor of Law at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. ""this is an important, compendious, and thought-provoking work that should be on the shelves of everyone interested in equity studies."" Mark Fortier, Law and Literature ""there is much of interest to the legal historian...the book's insights and erudition did engage this rather sceptical reader, who would like to believe that equity could achieve justice, but fears rather that it can only be as fair as the court dispensing it."" Rosemary Auchmuty, The Journal of Legal History ""With luck, Equity Stirring will stir...taxonomic positivists from their culture of entitlement, waking them to the possibility that law and justice do not form the perfect quadration"". Nick Piska, Social & Legal Studies ""a highly imaginative, original and refreshing foray into the legal and ethical import of concepts too often thought to be difficult, archaic and obscure...Watt gives us a way into the subject which is forceful in its imaginative reach and its ethical import...""

93,The Future of Private Equity,Beyond the Mega Buyout,Mark Bishop,"The private equity industry is at a cross-roads. In the easy money years between 2004 and 2008, it was awash with investment, debt was easily obtained and some rash, over-leveraged deals were done by the so-called ""mega buyout"" funds. Today, fund managers are dealing with the legacy of that era, while also figuring out how best to secure new investment and make attractive returns in the age of deleveraging. Many firms are succeeding, sometimes spectacularly, in both developed and emerging markets. Some have developed innovative new business models, while others have reinvented the old. This book contains exclusive interviews with the leaders of many of the world's most successful and innovative funds. These include: Steve Klinsky and Ajit Nedungadi of US growth investors New Mountain Capital and TA Associates; Jon Moulton and Wol Kolade of the British turnaround and growth specialists Better Capital and ISIS Equity Partners; Niten Malhan of Warburg Pincus' Indian operation; Derek Sulger, an Anglo-American who transitioned from setting up telecoms businesses in China to founding Lunar Capital, which backs indigenous entrepreneurs; pan-emerging market specialist Actis and innovative investors in Africa and the Middle East such as Citadel Capital's Hisham El-Khazindar and Abraaj's Mustafa Abdel-Wadood. These in-depth interviews tease out issues such as how private equity managers can best create enterprise value and out-perform public markets without returning to pre-crisis levels of leverage, techniques for differentiating a firm's capital, the sustainability of private equity in emerging markets, the role of the industry in low-income countries and alternatives to the established limited partnership governance model.

95,Excellence Through Equity,Five Principles of Courageous Leadership to Guide Achievement for Every Student,Alan M. Blankstein,"Excellence Through Equity is an inspiring look at how real-world educators are creating schools where all students are able to thrive. In these schools, educators understand that equity is not about treating all children the same. They are deeply committed to ensuring that each student receives what he or she individually needs to develop their full potential—and succeed. To help educators with what can at times be a difficult and challenging journey, Blankstein and Noguera frame the book with five guiding principles of Courageous Leadership: - Getting to your core - Making organizational meaning - Ensuring constancy and consistency of purpose - Facing the facts and your fears - Building sustainable relationships They further emphasize that the practices are grounded in three important areas of research that are too often disregarded: (1) child development, (2) neuroscience, and (3) environmental influences on child development and learning. You’ll hear from Carol Corbett Burris, Michael Fullan, Marcus J. Newsome, Paul Reville, Susan Szachowicz, and other bold practitioners and visionary thinkers who share compelling and actionable ideas, strategies, and experiences for closing the achievement gap in your classrooms and school. Ensuring that all students receive an education that cultivates their talents and potential is in all our common interest.

103,The Handbook of Equity Derivatives,,Jack Clark Francis,"""There are so many ways to use derivatives that I'm almost surprised when someone doesn't use them. Producers and consumers, investors and issuers, hedgers and speculators, governments and financial institutions: almost everyone can use them."" - From the Foreword by Fischer Black, Cocreator of the Black-Scholes Model Never before has there been so much interest in equity derivatives-or so much innovation in structuring these products. As new forms of instruments proliferate, their complexity has grown as well. Even equity derivatives professionals are unlikely to know all the details about every existing structure. With equity derivatives comprising one of the most important components of the capital markets, it's more crucial than ever for every financial professional, specialist and nonspecialist alike, to understand how derivative instruments behave, how they're structured, and how to use them profitably. Edited by leading thinkers in the field, The Handbook of Equity Derivatives, Revised Edition, assembles dozens of experts from universities and Wall Street to help the reader gain a practical grasp of the growing variety of financial instruments and how they work. Contributions from such respected authorities as Gary Gastineau, Mark Rubinstein, J. Gregg Whittaker, and Fischer Black outline the full range of the equity derivatives market, from classic warrants, options, and futures to the new and innovative PERCs, equity swaps, and equity-linked bonds. In nonmathematical language, the book provides a clear introduction to equity derivatives, including the fundamentals and history of options, basic equity structures, and pricing determinants, along with a historical perspective on their evolution. You'll find thorough surveys of: * The burgeoning field of synthetic structures-OTC options and exotics, equity swaps, SPINs, SIGNs, PENs, MITTs, and SuperShares * U.S. and foreign derivatives traded on organized exchanges * Issuer derivative structures, such as warrants, convertibles, PERCs, and unbundled stock units * The unique tax, legal, accounting, and regulatory features of derivatives * How to make the most profitable use of the many equity derivative products * Why some financial instruments succeed-and others fail * The future of the equity derivative market- place Whether you're a finance student becoming familiar with the field or a practicing professional seeking better ways to exploit the tremendous potential of equity derivatives for profit, The Handbook of Equity Derivatives, Revised Edition belongs on your bookshelf. ""I heartily endorse The Handbook of Equity Derivatives . . . while the market is continuously inventing new instruments and discarding older ones, the clarity and straightforward nature of the handbook hints at a longevity that will make it useful for many years to come."" - Stephen A. Ross Sterling Professor of Economics and Finance, MIT (on the first edition) The most relied-upon resource on equity derivative instruments, their structure, and diverse global markets- now extensively revised and updated Once, equity derivatives were exotic instruments relegated to the hands of specialists.

Recognized for its authoritative contributors and its accessible, comprehensive coverage of the entire field, The Handbook of Equity Derivatives has become the standard reference on the subject for specialist and nonspecialist alike. Now, this essential resource has been carefully updated and revised to cover the most current innovations in these continually evolving investment vehicles, including: * Comprehensive coverage of the all-important OTC market * Basic equity structures and how they work * Pricing determinants * PERCs, SPIDERs, and WEBs * The Black-Scholes model * The best uses for and profit potential of new derivative products * Key accounting, tax, and regulatory issues",0471326038,

As the field has expanded, a growing number of researchers have been tracking these phenomena: explaining how and why concepts of metropolitan development are being reframed; documenting the efforts to shape policies and diversify leadership; assessing where and how equity and social justice concerns have been brought into regional planning for transportation, land use, housing, public finances, environmental quality, smart growth, sustainable development, public health and other issue areas.

112,Managing Brand Equity,,David A. Aaker,"The most important assets of any business are intangible: its company name, brands, symbols, and slogans, and their underlying associations, perceived quality, name awareness, customer base, and proprietary resources such as patents, trademarks, and channel relationships. These assets, which comprise brand equity, are a primary source of competitive advantage and future earnings, contends David Aaker, a national authority on branding. Yet, research shows that managers cannot identify with confidence their brand associations, levels of consumer awareness, or degree of customer loyalty. Moreover in the last decade, managers desperate for short-term financial results have often unwittingly damaged their brands through price promotions and unwise brand extensions, causing irreversible deterioration of the value of the brand name. Although several companies, such as Canada Dry and Colgate-Palmolive, have recently created an equity management position to be guardian of the value of brand names, far too few managers, Aaker concludes, really understand the concept of brand equity and how it must be implemented. In a fascinating and insightful examination of the phenomenon of brand equity, Aaker provides a clear and well-defined structure of the relationship between a brand and its symbol and slogan, as well as each of the five underlying assets, which will clarify for managers exactly how brand equity does contribute value. The author opens each chapter with a historical analysis of either the success or failure of a particular company's attempt at building brand equity: the fascinating Ivory soap story; the transformation of Datsun to Nissan; the decline of Schlitz beer; the making of the Ford Taurus; and others. Finally, citing examples from many other companies, Aaker shows how to avoid the temptation to place short-term performance before the health of the brand and, instead, to manage brands strategically by creating, developing, and exploiting each of the five assets in turn",1439188386,

116,Equity,How to Design Organizations Where Everyone Thrives,Minal Bopaiah,"Equity is a big ask. This book helps leaders identify institutional structures that support inequity, and use human-centered design and the psychology of behavior change to embed equity into every aspect of their organizations. Equity is a goal that every forward-looking organization strives for. But it's hard to achieve when inequity is built, often unknowingly, into the very structure of so many organizations. But Minal Bopaiah goes beyond merely pointing out hidden structural inequities. Through an innovative use of the principles of human-centered design (HCD) and behavior change management, she shows how leaders can honor and elevate the humanity of everyone in their organizations. HCD centers on the needs and requirements of people first, not organizations. With this as a guiding principle, Bopaiah explains how leaders can become more aware of inequities in existing systems and be transparent about how they may have benefited, modeling the behavior they want to see in their employees. She looks at how to communicate internally about new policies so that they lead to actual behavior changes, not just shrugs. And she shows how to embed inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility into external communications and marketing, your organization's face to the world. This is an engaging and original guide to creating welcoming organizations where everyone flourishes.",1523090251,Equity How to Design Organizations Where Everyone Thrives

132,Equity in English Renaissance Literature,Thomas More and Edmund Spenser,Andrew J. Majeske,"This book accounts for the previously inadequately explained transformation in the meaning of equity in sixteenth century England, a transformation which, intriguingly, first comes to light in literary texts rather than political or legal treatises. The book address the two principal literary works in which the transformation becomes apparent, Thomas More's Utopia and Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene, and sketches the history of equity to its roots in the Greek concept of epieikeia, uncovering along the way both previously unexplained distinctions, and a long-obscured esoteric meaning. These rediscoveries, when brought to bear upon the Utopia and Faerie Queene, illuminate critical though relatively neglected textual passages that have long puzzled scholars.",9780415977050,Equity in English Renaissance Literature Thomas More and Edmund Spenser
137,Making Equity Planning Work,Leadership in the Public Sector,Norman Krumholz,"From 1969 to 1979, Cleveland?s city planning staff under Norman Krumholz?s leadership conducted a unique experiment in equity oriented planning. Fighting to defend the public welfare while also assisting the city?s poorest citizens, these planners combined professional competence and political judgment to bring pressing urban issues to the public?s attention. Although frequently embroiled in controversy while serving three different mayors, the Cleveland planners not only survived, but accomplished impressive equity objectives. In this book, Norman Krumholz and John Forester provide the first detailed personal account of a sustained and effective equity-planning practice that influenced urban policy. Krumholz describes the pragmatic equity-planning agenda that his staff pursued during the mayoral administrations of Carl B. Stokes, Ralph J. Perk, and Dennis J. Kucinich. He presents case studies illuminated with rich personal experience, of the Euclid Beach development, the Clark Freeway, and the tax-delinquency and land-banking project that resulted in a change in the State of Ohio?s property law, among others. In the second part of the book, John Forester explores the implications of this experience and the lessons that can be drawn for planning, public management, and administrative practice more generally.",0877227012,Making Equity Planning Work Leadership in the Public Sector

Dies lag zum einen an der grossen medialen Beachtung von Unternehmensubernahmen und zum anderen an wichtigen Impulsen in der Auslegung des Discounted-Cashflow-Ansatz (DCF-Ansatz) von Miller/Modigliani (1961) hin zu einer strategischen Unternehmensbewertung. Vor allem Unternehmensberater und Investment-Banker propagierieren ihren Einsatz.

151,The Difference,"How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies",Scott E. Page,"In this landmark book, Scott Page redefines the way we understand ourselves in relation to one another. The Difference is about how we think in groups--and how our collective wisdom exceeds the sum of its parts. Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? And why are the best group decisions and predictions those that draw upon the very qualities that make each of us unique? The answers lie in diversity--not what we look like outside, but what we look like within, our distinct tools and abilities. The Difference reveals that progress and innovation may depend less on lone thinkers with enormous IQs than on diverse people working together and capitalizing on their individuality. Page shows how groups that display a range of perspectives outperform groups of like-minded experts. Diversity yields superior outcomes, and Page proves it using his own cutting-edge research. Moving beyond the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, he explains why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you're talking about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory. He examines practical ways to apply diversity's logic to a host of problems, and along the way offers fascinating and surprising examples, from the redesign of the Chicago El to the truth about where we store our ketchup. Page changes the way we understand diversity--how to harness its untapped potential, how to understand and avoid its traps, and how we can leverage our differences for the benefit of all.",0691128383,"The Difference How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies"

159,The Department Chair as Transformative Diversity Leader,Building Inclusive Learning Environments in Higher Education,Edna Chun,"With the imminent demographic shifts in our society and the need to prepare students for citizenship in a global, knowledge-based society, the role of the academic department chair in creating diverse and inclusive learning environments is arguably the most pivotal position in higher education today. In the United States, increasing minority student enrollment coupled with the emergence of a minority majority American nation by 2042 demands that academic institutions be responsive to these changing demographics. The isolation of the ivory tower is no longer an option. This is the first book to address the role of the department chair in diversity and addresses an unmet need by providing a research-based, systematic approach to diversity leadership in the academic department based upon survey findings and in-person interviews. The department chair represents the nexus between the faculty and the administration and is positioned uniquely to impact diversity progress. Research indicates that more than 80 percent of academic decisions regarding appointment, curriculum, tenure and promotion, classroom pedagogy, and student outcomes are made by the department chair in consultation with the faculty. This book examines the multidimensional contributions that chairs make in advancing diversity within their departments and institutions in the representation of diverse faculty and staff; in tenure and promotion; curricular change; student learning outcomes; and departmental climate. The scope and content of the book is not limited to institutions in the United States but is applicable to academic institutions globally in their efforts to address the access and success of increasingly diverse student populations. It addresses institutional power structures and the role of the dean in relation to the appointment of chairs and their impact on the success of chairs from non-dominant groups, including female, minority, and lesbian/gay/transgendered individuals who serve in predominantly white male departments. Using qualitative and quantitative research methods, the book analyzes predominant structural and behavioral barriers that can impede diversity progress within the academic department. It then focuses upon the opportunities and challenges chairs face in their collaborative journey with faculty and administration toward inclusive departmental and institutional practices. Each chapter provides concrete strategies that chairs can use to strengthen diversity in the academic department. Addressed to department chairs, deans, faculty, and administrative leaders in higher education in all Western societies facing demographic change and global challenges, this book offers a critical road map to creating the successful academic institutions that will meet the needs of our changing populations.",9781620362402,The Department Chair as Transformative Diversity Leader Building Inclusive Learning Environments in Higher Education

169,The Diversity Machine,The Drive to Change the White Male Workplace,Frederick R. Lynch,"""Diversity"" has become the turn-of-the-century buzzword. Republican and Democratic leaders ritually chant ""diversity is our strength"" and corporate CEOs talk about the need to create a ""workforce that looks like America."" Most corporate mission statements now contain a clause on ""valuing differences"" and millions of employees have completed-or soon will undergo-some sort of ""diversity training."" Where did all this come from -and why? Who created diversity programs? How do they differ? How effective are these policies? Can they do more harm than good in organizations and in the wider society?During the past decade, sociologist Frederick R. Lynch studied the rise of a social policy movement that has successfully moved multiculturalism from universities and foundations into the courts, mass media, and the American workplace. The new diversity policies are future-oriented and market-driven, eclipsing ""old"" affirmative action debates about overcoming past discrimination against blacks.Based on more than six years of field research and hundreds of interviews, Lynch tracks the development and impact of different forms of diversity policies at dozens of consultant gatherings, in the business and professional literature and through in-depth case studies such as the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He profiles the major consultants who have powered the diversity machine, analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of various approaches to workplace diversity and provides numerous ""you-are-there"" samples of workshops, seminars, and conferences.The book is written for the general reader interested in public-policy issues, social scientists, and others interested in the origins and consequences of workplace diversity policies.",9781351483513,The Diversity Machine The Drive to Change the White Male Workplace

173,Dialect Diversity in America,The Politics of Language Change,William Labov,"The sociolinguist William Labov has worked for decades on change in progress in American dialects and on African American Vernacular English (AAVE). In Dialect Diversity in America, Labov examines the diversity among American dialects and presents the counterintuitive finding that geographically localized dialects of North American English are increasingly diverging from one another over time. Contrary to the general expectation that mass culture would diminish regional differences, the dialects of Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Birmingham, Buffalo, Philadelphia, and New York are now more different from each other than they were a hundred years ago. Equally significant is Labov's finding that AAVE does not map with the geography and timing of changes in other dialects. The home dialect of most African American speakers has developed a grammar that is more and more different from that of the white mainstream dialects in the major cities studied and yet highly homogeneous throughout the United States. Labov describes the political forces that drive these ongoing changes, as well as the political consequences in public debate. The author also considers the recent geographical reversal of political parties in the Blue States and the Red States and the parallels between dialect differences and the results of recent presidential elections. Finally, in attempting to account for the history and geography of linguistic change among whites, Labov highlights fascinating correlations between patterns of linguistic divergence and the politics of race and slavery, going back to the antebellum United States. Complemented by an online collection of audio files that illustrate key dialectical nuances, Dialect Diversity in America offers an unparalleled sociolinguistic study from a preeminent scholar in the field.",0813935881,Dialect Diversity in America The Politics of Language Change

183,"Safe Spaces, Brave Spaces",Diversity and Free Expression in Education,John Palfrey,"""Safe spaces, trigger warnings, microagressions, the disinvitation of speakers, demands to rename campus landmarks -- debate over these issues began in lecture halls and on college quads but ended up on op-ed pages in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, on cable news, and on social media. Some of these critiques had merit, but others took a series of cheap shots at 'crybullies' who needed to be coddled and protected from the real world. Few questioned the assumption that colleges must choose between free expression and diversity. In [this book, the author] argues that the essential democratic values of diversity and free expression can, and should, coexist on campus. [The author] writes that free expression and diversity are more compatible than opposed. Free expression can serve everyone -- even if it has at times been dominated by white, male, Christian, heterosexual, able-bodied citizens. Diversity is about self-expression, learning from one another, and working together across differences; it can encompass academic freedom without condoning hate speech. [The author] proposes an innovative way to support both diversity and free expression on campus: creating safe spaces and brave spaces. In safe spaces, students can explore ideas and express themselves with without feeling marginalized. In brave spaces -- classrooms, lecture halls, public forums -- the search for knowledge is paramount, even if some discussions may make certain students uncomfortable. The strength of our democracy...depends on a commitment to upholding both diversity and free expression, especially when it is hardest to do so.""--Résumé de l'éditeur.",9780262037143,"Safe Spaces, Brave Spaces Diversity and Free Expression in Education"
185,Evolution's Rainbow,"Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People",Joan Roughgarden,"In this innovative celebration of diversity and affirmation of individuality in animals and humans, Joan Roughgarden challenges accepted wisdom about gender identity and sexual orientation. A distinguished evolutionary biologist, Roughgarden takes on the medical establishment, the Bible, social science—and even Darwin himself. She leads the reader through a fascinating discussion of diversity in gender and sexuality among fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, including primates. Evolution's Rainbow explains how this diversity develops from the action of genes and hormones and how people come to differ from each other in all aspects of body and behavior. Roughgarden reconstructs primary science in light of feminist, gay, and transgender criticism and redefines our understanding of sex, gender, and sexuality. Witty, playful, and daring, this book will revolutionize our understanding of sexuality. Roughgarden argues that principal elements of Darwinian sexual selection theory are false and suggests a new theory that emphasizes social inclusion and control of access to resources and mating opportunity. She disputes a range of scientific and medical concepts, including Wilson's genetic determinism of behavior, evolutionary psychology, the existence of a gay gene, the role of parenting in determining gender identity, and Dawkins's ""selfish gene"" as the driver of natural selection. She dares social science to respect the agency and rationality of diverse people; shows that many cultures across the world and throughout history accommodate people we label today as lesbian, gay, and transgendered; and calls on the Christian religion to acknowledge the Bible's many passages endorsing diversity in gender and sexuality. Evolution's Rainbow concludes with bold recommendations for improving education in biology, psychology, and medicine; for democratizing genetic engineering and medical practice; and for building a public monument to affirm diversity as one of our nation's defining principles.",9780520957978,"Evolution's Rainbow Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People"

191,The Uses of Diversity,Essays in Polycentricity,David Ellerman,"The author argues for the virtues of diversity in cities, organizations, strategies for development, and human discourse in general. The opening chapter develops the vision of Jane Jacobs (the ""diva of diversity"") for the development of city regions. Many of the later chapters are based on the author's ten years in the World Bank and Senior Advisor and speechwriter for Joseph Stiglitz. Many of the problems in the World Bank's policies were based on a narrow ideological vision that did not tolerate a diversity of pragmatic approaches to the complex questions of economic and social development. Finally, the narrow social-engineering criterion for evaluating social projects is cost-benefit analysis, and the penultimate chapter develops a logical fallacy in the Kaldor-Hicks Principle that is the theoretical basis for cost-benefit analysis.",9781793623737,The Uses of Diversity Essays in Polycentricity
193,"Start where You Are, But Don't Stay There","Understanding Diversity, Opportunity Gaps, and Teaching in Today's Classrooms",H. Richard Milner,"Start Where You Are, But Don't Stay There addresses a crucial issue in teacher training and professional education: the need to prepare preservice and inservice teachers for the racially diverse student populations in their classrooms. The book centers on case studies that exemplify the challenges, pitfalls, and opportunities facing teachers in diverse classrooms. These case studies of white and African American teachers working (and preparing to work) in urban and suburban settings are presented amid more general discussions about race and teaching in contemporary schools. Informing these discussions and the cases themselves is their persistent attention to opportunity gaps that need to be fully grasped by teachers who aim to understand and promote the success of students of greatly varying backgrounds.",1934742767,"Start where You Are, But Don't Stay There Understanding Diversity, Opportunity Gaps, and Teaching in Today's Classrooms"

The most successful urban communities are very often those that are the most diverse – in terms of income, age, family structure and ethnicity – and yet poor urban design and planning can stifle the very diversity that makes communities successful. Just as poor urban design can lead to sterile monoculture, successful planning can support the conditions needed for diverse communities. Emily Talen explores the linkage between urban forms and social diversity, and how one impacts the other. Learning the lessons from past successes and failures, and building from detailed case studies of different neighborhoods, Design for Diversity provides urban designers and architects with design strategies and tools to ensure that their work sustains and nurtures social diversity. * Explores the link between urban form and social diversity * Based on detailed studies of socially diverse neighbourhoods in cities * Outlines urban design strategies to support diverse communities",9780750681179,Design for Diversity Exploring Socially Mixed Neighborhoods

More people than ever seek graduate degrees, but little has been written about who gets in and why. Drawing on firsthand observations of admission committees and interviews with faculty in 10 top-ranked doctoral programs in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, education professor Julie Posselt pulls back the curtain on a process usually conducted in secret. “Politicians, judges, journalists, parents and prospective students subject the admissions policies of undergraduate colleges and professional schools to considerable scrutiny, with much public debate over appropriate criteria. But the question of who gets into Ph.D. programs has by comparison escaped much discussion. That may change with the publication of Inside Graduate Admissions...While the departments reviewed in the book remain secret, the general process used by elite departments would now appear to be more open as a result of Posselt’s book.” —Scott Jaschik, Inside Higher Ed “Revealing...Provide[s] clear, consistent insights into what admissions committees look for.” —Beryl Lieff Benderly, Science",0674984048,"Inside Graduate Admissions Merit, Diversity, and Faculty Gatekeeping"
201,Conducting an Institutional Diversity Audit in Higher Education,A Practitioner's Guide to Systematic Diversity Transformation,Edna Chun,"Implementing systematic diversity transformation requires embracing all aspects of diversity—gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identification, and other salient characteristics of difference—as well as race and ethnicity. This book lays out a framework for systematic and sustained diversity process that first recognizes that too many diversity initiatives have generated more statements of intent than actual change, and that audits conducted by outside bodies frequently fail to achieve buy-in or long-term impact, and are costly endeavors. The authors’ framework identifies nine dimensions that need to be addressed to achieve a comprehensive audit that leads to action, describes the underlying research-based practices, and offers guidance on ensuring that all relevant voices are heard. The process is designed to be implemented by and within the institution, saving the considerable expense of outside consulting and design. In addition, it offers flexibility in the timing and sequence of implementation, and provides the means for each institution to interrogate its unique circumstances, context, and practices. This book provides a concrete process for data gathering, analysis, and evaluation of institution-wide diversity efforts through a progressive, modular approach to diversity transformation. It provides campuses with the ability to audit, evaluate, and analyze diversity progress on the nine dimensions and prioritize areas of focus. Its systematic, research-based approach supports continuous improvement and proactively addresses accreditation criteria. The book is designed as a collaborative tool that will enable every constituency on campus—from boards of trustees, presidents, provosts, executive officers, diversity officers, deans, department heads and chairs, administrators, HR officers, faculty senates and staff councils, diversity taskforces, multicultural centers, faculty, and researchers—to identify processes and relationships that need to change and implement practices that value and support the diversity on their campuses, and undertake the transformation necessary for institutional success in a changing world. The questions and guidelines set out in this book will enable all stakeholders to: • Audit the progress on each diversity dimension • Identify gaps between research-based practices and current approaches • Tie diversity benchmarks to accreditation frameworks and strategic plans • Chart the organization’s overall progress in the development of comprehensive diversity initiatives leading toward Inclusive Excellence • Prioritize institutional diversity initiatives based upon a comparison of the current state and the desired state, availability of resources, and the importance of each dimension in relation to institutional diversity goals • Create a long-term strategy for diversity transformation that provides a concrete, research-based method for auditing progress and future planning",9781620368213,Conducting an Institutional Diversity Audit in Higher Education A Practitioner's Guide to Systematic Diversity Transformation
203,Diversity Leadership in Higher Education,ASHE Higher Education Report,"Adalberto Aguirre, Jr.","Promoting diversity as a core value among social groups is one of the major challenges faced by institutions of higher education in the United States. By focusing on racial and ethnic minorities in higher education, this monograph provides a view of diversity as a positive and dynamic social force in society that promotes its integration as a core value and process. Diversity leadership challenges higher education to move beyond co-optation strategies, in which diversity is viewed as a descriptive and static organizational element, to the adoption of transformational strategies, in which diversity is viewed as a dynamic and positive process. Through the promotion and development of diversity leadership, institutional leadership is seen as building capacity to promote inclusive learning and workplace environments in colleges and universities. As demographic shifts in US society create an ever expanding context in which the well-being of the nation becomes increasingly linked to the social and cultural groups that have been systematically excluded from full participation in American society, the need for positive cultural and structural changes that foster their inclusion in higher education becomes an important challenge to address. This volume provides an overview of the context for diversity leadership roles and practices in higher education. It argues for an alignment between institutions of higher education and the diverse populations they serve in this country.

204,Diversity in Deaf Education,,Marc Marschark,"Deaf children are not hearing children who can't hear. Beyond any specific effects of hearing loss, as a group they are far more diverse than hearing peers. Lack of full access to language, incidental learning, and social interactions as well as the possibility of secondary disabilities means that deaf learners face a variety of challenges in academic domains. Technological innovations such as digital hearing aids and cochlear implants have improved hearing and the possibility of spoken language for many deaf learners, but parents, teachers, and other professionals are just now coming to recognize that there are cognitive, experiential, and social-emotional differences between deaf and hearing students likely to affect academic outcomes. Sign languages and schools and programs for deaf learners thus remain an important part of the continuum of services needed for this diverse population. Understanding such diversity and determining ways in which to accommodate them must become a top priority in educating deaf learners. Through the participation of an international, interdisciplinary set of scholars, Diversity in Deaf Education takes a broad view of learning and academic progress, considering ""the whole child"" in the context of the families, languages, educational settings in which they are immersed. In adopting this perspective, the complexities and commonalities in the social, emotional, cognitive, and linguistic mosaic of which the deaf child is a part, are captured. It is only through such a holistic consideration of diverse children developing within diverse settings that we can understand their academic potentials.",9780190493073,

Smith,"A new edition of The Challenge of Diversity with new introduction from the editors, which compares today's statistics to those in 1989. The original monograph is still valuable and relevant, and it is presented in its original form. In 1989 when The Challenge of Diversity was first published, the monograph made the case that the country's changing demographics required reframing diversity to focus on institutions' capacity to educate and involve an increasingly diverse student population. Looking at current research, the book pointed to patterns of alienation, not involvment. Our demographics are indeed different today, but many of the same challenges remain: access and success for historically underrepresented minority groups, but also the basic institutional issues such as curriculum, climate, and hiring. At the same time, the context has changed: nontraditional students (older students, women, and part-timers) are now mainstream, and numbers of some minority groups and multiracial students continues to grow. While higher education has changed profoundly, our institutions still have not yet developed the capacity to successfuly educate the diversity of students present on our campuses today. In addition, we are experiencing a backlash to some diversity initiatives, and societal factors indicate that higher education needs to become more proactive in responding favorably to diversity. If the monograph were first published today, we would call it The Imperative of Diversity.

225,The Diversity Delusion,How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and Undermine Our Culture,Heather Mac Donald,"By the New York Times bestselling author: a provocative account of the attack on the humanities, the rise of intolerance, and the erosion of serious learning America is in crisis, from the university to the workplace. Toxic ideas first spread by higher education have undermined humanistic values, fueled intolerance, and widened divisions in our larger culture. Chaucer, Shakespeare and Milton? Oppressive. American history? Tyranny. Professors correcting grammar and spelling, or employers hiring by merit? Racist and sexist. Students emerge into the working world believing that human beings are defined by their skin color, gender, and sexual preference, and that oppression based on these characteristics is the American experience. Speech that challenges these campus orthodoxies is silenced with brute force. The Diversity Delusion argues that the root of this problem is the belief in America’s endemic racism and sexism, a belief that has engendered a metastasizing diversity bureaucracy in society and academia. Diversity commissars denounce meritocratic standards as discriminatory, enforce hiring quotas, and teach students and adults alike to think of themselves as perpetual victims. From #MeToo mania that blurs flirtations with criminal acts, to implicit bias and diversity compliance training that sees racism in every interaction, Heather Mac Donald argues that we are creating a nation of narrowed minds, primed for grievance, and that we are putting our competitive edge at risk. But there is hope in the works of authors, composers, and artists who have long inspired the best in us. Compiling the author’s decades of research and writing on the subject, The Diversity Delusion calls for a return to the classical liberal pursuits of open-minded inquiry and expression, by which everyone can discover a common humanity.",9781250200921,The Diversity Delusion How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and Undermine Our Culture

The days of two genders—male, female; boy, girl; blue, pink—are over, if they ever existed at all. Gender is now a global conversation, and one that is constantly evolving. More people than ever before are openly living their lives as transgender men or women, and many transgender people are coming out as neither men nor women, instead living outside of the binary. Gender is changing, and this change is gaining momentum. We all want to do and say the right things in relation to gender diversity—whether at a job interview, at parent/teacher night, and around the table at family dinners. But where do we begin? From the differences among gender identity, gender expression, and sex, to the use of gender-neutral pronouns like singular they/them, to thinking about your own participation in gender, Gender: Your Guide serves as “a warm, inviting guide to a complicated area” (The Globe and Mail, Toronto). Professor and gender diversity advocate Lee Airton, PhD, explains how gender works in everyday life; how to use accurate terminology to refer to transgender, non-binary, and/or gender non-conforming individuals; and how to ask when you aren’t sure what to do or say. It provides the information you need to talk confidently and compassionately about gender diversity, whether simply having a conversation or going to bat as an advocate.

Excerpt: Grammatical gender is defined linguistically as a system of classes of nouns which trigger specific types of inflections in associated words, such as adjectives, verbs and others. For a system of noun classes to be a gender system, every noun must belong to one of the classes and there should be very few that belong to several classes at once. If a language distinguishes between genders, in order to correctly decline any noun and any modifier or other type of word affected by that noun, one must identify the gender of the noun. While Old English (Anglo-Saxon) had grammatical gender, Modern English is normally described as lacking grammatical gender. The linguistic notion of grammatical gender is distinguished from the biological and social notion of natural gender, although they interact closely in many languages. Both grammatical and natural gender can have linguistic effects in a given language. Grammatical gender is typical of Afro-Asiatic, Dravidian, Indo-European, Northeast Caucasian, and several Australian aboriginal languages such as Dyirbal. It is usually absent in the Altaic, Austronesian, Sino-Tibetan, Uralic and most Native American language families. The Niger-Congo languages typically have an extensive system of noun classes, which can be grouped into several grammatical genders (Corbett, ..",1230649662,"Gender in Language Gender-Neutral Language, Grammatical Gender, Gender Neutrality in English, Gender-Neutral Pronoun, Gender-Specific Pronoun, Gender"
311,The Effects of the Lack of a Gender-neutral Singular Pronoun on Business Communication,,Kristina Peszel,"The English language suffers from a noticeable lack of an epicene pronoun. This absence has lead speakers of English to implement several different techniques to ameliorate this gap with varying degrees of success and acceptance. Because the language's pronoun system is based on gender, pronoun usage has been of enduring interest to feminists, culminating in feminist linguistic scholarship and advocacy. With this linguistic and sociopolitical context, this study uses corpus linguistics to examine business documents from several well-known technology companies to analyze how the technology sector approaches gender via application of gender pronouns. Samples from the corpus whose meaning is negatively affected by the lack of an epicene pronoun are then replaced with gender-neutral neologisms and singular they pronouns to study change in meaning and connotation.",OCLC:908396970,

The collection provides a framework for thinking about the relevance of Transgender Studies for the field of education and specifically for K-12 schooling contexts. It argues for the need to engage transgender-informed epistemologies and provides insight into trans-affirmative education research, policy contexts, and practices with the view to generating knowledge about how the experiences of transgender and non-binary youth, gender non-conformity, and gender-creative expression are being addressed in the education system. Topics addressed range from trans-informed policy analysis and enactment across various contexts to addressing central concerns and polemics related to the policing and regulation of students’ gender identities and expression, with respect to washroom space in schools and the use of gender-neutral pronouns. The book is timely and pertinent, especially given that transphobia and addressing gender justice in the education system have been identified as significant human rights issues which require urgent intervention.

318,Nonbinary,Memoirs of Gender and Identity,Micah Rajunov,"What happens when your gender doesn’t fit neatly into the categories of male or female? Even mundane interactions like filling out a form or using a public bathroom can be a struggle when these designations prove inadequate. In this groundbreaking book, thirty authors highlight how our experiences are shaped by a deeply entrenched gender binary. The powerful first-person narratives of this collection show us a world where gender exists along a spectrum, a web, a multidimensional space. Nuanced storytellers break away from mainstream portrayals of gender diversity, cutting across lines of age, race, ethnicity, ability, class, religion, family, and relationships. From Suzi, who wonders whether she’ll ever “feel” like a woman after living fifty years as a man, to Aubri, who grew up in a cash-strapped fundamentalist household, to Sand, who must reconcile the dual roles of trans advocate and therapist, the writers’ conceptions of gender are inextricably intertwined with broader systemic issues. Labeled gender outlaws, gender rebels, genderqueer, or simply human, the voices in Nonbinary illustrate what life could be if we allowed the rigid categories of “man” and “woman” to loosen and bend. They speak to everyone who has questioned gender or has paused to wonder, What does it mean to be a man or a woman—and why do we care so much?",9780231546102,Nonbinary Memoirs of Gender and Identity

324,Gender Variant Neologisms,,,"This qualitative research was designed to answer questions about language, perceptions of identity, and the possibility of mainstream adoption of gender variant neologisms (GVN). Twenty semistructured interviews with college students who were familiar with GVN form the base of this work. Eight participants identified with gender neutral pronouns and preferred to have ze/hir or they/them used in reference to them. Additionally, two participants were considering switching to epicene pronouns. Participants were very mindful of not wanting to hurt other people with their linguistic choices. The research reveals that the use of GVN is often rather heated, confusing, and requires a tremendous amount of re-education as mainstream society begins to adopt gender neutral language. Language is actively being modified at the university and state level as a way to be more inclusive; this change is significant in that it indicates a move toward a more tolerant mainstream view of gender. As society begins to adopt gender neutral language and enforcement of protections for people not aligned with the gender binary, GVN will help to protect a class of people who still have very few civil rights.",OCLC:841982703,

326,A Gender Neutral God/ess,Be Inclusive But MAKE NO IMAGES Was the Religious Change,Jennifer J. McKenzie,"For centuries a mainstream belief of Hebrew and Christian worshippers has been that their ""God"" is masculine. That was not the intent of many early biblical writers. Instead an imageless, inclusive she/he Deity was postulated. This book explores that thesis. It documents the literary devices early religious writers used to portray a gender inclusive Deity. Topics discussed are the use of plurals, mother/father language, gendered words, poetic parallelism, Spirit and Wisdom as feminine dimensions, and names or labels for the Deity. The origin of the deity name YHWH is traced and linked to early mythology of the ancient Goddess IO. Finally, the idea of a neuter, gender inclusive deity is followed through the story of Jesus Christ. To visually demonstrate this thesis, 83 illustrations of ancient artifacts, maps, and diagrams are included.

332,The New Gender Paradox,Fragmentation and Persistence of the Binary,Judith Lorber,"Today, in Western countries, we are seeing both the fragmentation of the gender binary (the division of the social world into two and only two genders) and its persistence. Multiple genders, gender-neutral pronouns and bathrooms, X designations and other manifestations of degendering are becoming common and yet the two-gender structure of our social world persists. Underneath the persistence of the binary and its discriminatory norms and expectations lurks the continuance of men’s power and privilege. So there is the continued need to valorize the accomplishments of women, especially those of denigrated groups. This succinct and thoughtful book by one of the world’s foremost sociologists of gender shines a light on both sides of this paradox – processes in the fragmentation of gender that are undermining the binary and processes in the performance of gender that reinforce the binary, and the pros and cons of each. The conclusion of the book speculates about a feminist gender revolution and a world without gender.",1509544356,The New Gender Paradox Fragmentation and Persistence of the Binary

337,"Language, Cognition and Gender",,Alan Garnham,"Gender inequality remains an issue of high relevance, and controversy, in society. Previous research shows that language contributes to gender inequality in various ways: Gender-related information is transmitted through formal and semantic features of language, such as the grammatical category of gender, through gender-related connotations of role names (e.g., manager, secretary), and through customs of denoting social groups with derogatory vs. neutral names. Both as a formal system and as a means of communication, language passively reflects culture-specific social conditions. In active use it can also be used to express and, potentially, perpetuate those conditions. The questions addressed in the contributions to this Frontiers Special Topic include: • how languages shape the cognitive representations of gender • how features of languages correspond with gender equality in different societies • how language contributes to social behaviour towards the sexes • how gender equality can be promoted through strategies for gender-fair language use These questions are explored both developmentally (across the life span from childhood to old age) and in adults. The contributions present work conducted across a wide range of languages, including some studies that make cross-linguistic comparisons. Among the contributors are both cognitive and social psychologists and linguists, all with an excellent research standing. The studies employ a wide range of empirical methods: from surveys to electro-physiology. The papers in the Special Topic present a wide range of complimentary studies, which will make a substantial contribution to understanding in this important area.",9782889198924,
339,Nonbinary Gender Identities,"History, Culture, Resources",Charlie McNabb,"Nonbinary gender identities are those that fall outside the traditional binary of “man” and “woman.” These include genderfluid, androgynous, genderqueer, and a multitude of other identity terms, some of which overlap. Although there have always been people who identify outside the gender binary, only recently have they gained popular media attention. Despite some visibility, however, nonbinary gender identities are poorly understood by the general public. It is critically important for gender minorities to find themselves in the media that they consume. Just as important is the need for those outside the minority community to understand and appreciate them. Nonbinary gender identities are represented in books and other media, but these resources prove difficult to locate, as classification vocabulary doesn’t evolve as quickly as community language. Reference sources identified include archives and special collections, theses and dissertations, key journals, and related organizations and associations. This timely resource—the first reference on nonbinary gender identities—offers an accessible entry into researching this topic. Written by a nonbinary scholar and librarian, this guide includes valuable appendixes that will aid every researcher and writer: a glossary of the rich vocabulary emerging from nonbinary communities; a guide to pronoun usage; a primer on sex, sexuality, and gender; and Library of Congress Classification information.",9781442275522,"Nonbinary Gender Identities History, Culture, Resources"

355,Sex and Gender in Joseph Marx's 'Italienisches Liederbuch',Analysis and Performance,Sarah Levering,"When Joseph Marx (1882−1964) composed his collection of seventeen lieder under the title of Italienisches Liederbuch in 1912, he took the unusual step of notating explicitly in the score specific songs for male and female voices. In gendering his composition, Marx was likely following the model of Hugo Wolf’s identically titled Italienisches Liederbuch (1892/1896),which is (and was) customarily performed by two voices, male and female. This, however, was a performance convention that Wolf left unspecified in his score. Such specificity was unusual, as in the mature lieder tradition of the nineteenth century, while gender was often implied by the poetry—consider the male perspective in Schubert’s Die schöne Müllerin (1824) or the female perspective in Schumann’s Frauenliebe und -leben (1840)—it was rarely explicitly indicated int he score and songs were occasionally, if not frequently, performed by singers of either sex. To understand how Marx’s gendering decisions manifest themselves throughout the music and performance of the Liederbuch, this document will explore the gendered texts of Paul Heyse(1830−1914) and the gendered compositional elements in Marx’s score. Furthermore, this document will examine options available to singers who wish to modernize the performance ofthis work through the use of cross-singing and gender-neutral pronouns.",OCLC:1152522988,Sex and Gender in Joseph Marx's 'Italienisches Liederbuch' Analysis and Performance

359,"Gender-Neutral Language Reform. Necessary Process, or Mere Demand of Hypersensitive Feminists?",,Juliane Amthor,"Essay from the year 2012 in the subject Women Studies / Gender Studies, grade: 1,3, Free University of Berlin (Institut für englische Philologie), course: Linguistic Theory and the Grammar of English, language: English, abstract: What has been ridiculed by male columnists as feminists’ “pronoun envy”, and exaggeratedly depicted as their wish to change words like ‘manhole cover’ to ‘personhole cover”, and ‘manipulate’ to ‘personipulate’, in fact, is too important and well-grounded a demand to be ridiculed. Emerging in the 1960s / 70s, the issue of sexist language by many is still seen as a persistent problem today. The continuity of this claim shows that feminists in favour of gender-neutral language use are by no means concerned with trivialities, but with core concepts of language. (Cf. Penfield 1987:6) This essay is based on the positive statement of the above quotation that meanings are not fixed, but language responds to new demands posed on it by its speakers. Its aim is to prove that, especially in English with its natural gender system, strong sexist tendencies exist, and therefore language reform is possible and necessary to contribute to the formal and actual equality of women.",9783668062566,

""When the political reality facing this country seems dark, we need shinier, sparklier thinkers in the public eye. With a signature style matched only by their wit, Jacob fits that bill perfectly."" --Alan Cumming From the moment a doctor in Raleigh, North Carolina, put ""male"" on Jacob Tobia's birth certificate, everything went wrong. Alongside ""male"" came many other, far less neutral words: words that carried expectations about who Jacob was and who Jacob should be, words like ""masculine"" and ""aggressive"" and ""cargo shorts"" and ""SPORTS!"" Naturally sensitive, playful, creative, and glitter-obsessed, as a child Jacob was given the label ""sissy."" In the two decades that followed, ""sissy"" joined forces with ""gay,"" ""trans,"" ""nonbinary,"" and ""too-queer-to-function"" to become a source of pride and, today, a rallying cry for a much-needed gender revolution. Through revisiting their childhood and calling out the stereotypes that each of us have faced, Jacob invites us to rethink what we know about gender and offers a bold blueprint for a healed world--one free from gender-based trauma and bursting with trans-inclusive feminism. From Jacob's Methodist childhood and the hallowed halls of Duke University to the portrait-laden parlors of the White House, Sissy takes you on a gender odyssey you won't soon forget. Writing with the fierce honesty, wildly irreverent humor, and wrenching vulnerability that have made them a media sensation, Jacob shatters the long-held notion that people are easily sortable into ""men"" and ""women."" Sissy guarantees that you'll never think about gender--both other people's people's and your own--the same way again.",9780735218826,Sissy A Coming-of-Gender Story
373,Cancel Culture,The Latest Attack on Free Speech and Due Process,Alan Dershowitz,"In Cancel Culture, Alan Dershowitz—New York Times bestselling author and one of America’s most respected legal scholars—makes an argument for free speech, due process, and restraint against the often overeager impulse to completely cancel individuals and institutions at the ever-changing whims of social media-driven crowds. Alan Dershowitz has been called “one of the most prominent and consistent defenders of civil liberties in America” by Politico and “the nation’s most peripatetic civil liberties lawyer and one of its most distinguished defenders of individual rights” by Newsweek. Yet he has come under intense criticism for his steadfast and consistent championing of those same principles, and his famed “shoe‑on‑the‑other‑foot test,” to those who have been “cancelled” for any number of faults, both real and imagined. Cancel Culture is a defense of due process, free speech, and even-handedness in the application of judgment. It makes the case for restraint and care in decisions about whom and what to cancel, boycott, deplatform, and bar from public life, and offers recommendations for when, why, and to what degree these steps may be appropriate, as long as objective, fair-minded criteria can be determined and met. While Dershowitz argues against the worst excesses of cancel culture—the rush to judgment and the devastating results it can have on those who may be innocent, the power of social media to effect punishment without a thorough examination of evidence, the idea that historical events can be viewed through the same lens as actions in the present day—he also acknowledges that its defenders ostensibly try to use it to create meaningful, positive change, and notes that cancelling may itself be a constitutionally protected form of free speech. In the end, Cancel Culture represents an icon in the defense of free speech and due process reckoning with the greatest challenge and threat to these rights since the rise of McCarthyism. It is essential reading for anyone interested in or concerned about cancel culture, its effects on our society, and its significance in a greater historical and political context.",9781510764910,Cancel Culture The Latest Attack on Free Speech and Due Process
375,Takedown,Art in the Age of Cancel Culture,Farah Nayeri,"Farah Nayeri addresses the difficult questions plaguing the art world, from the bad habits of Old Masters, to the current grappling with identity politics. For centuries, art censorship has been a top-down phenomenon--kings, popes, and one-party states decided what was considered obscene, blasphemous, or politically deviant in art. Today, censorship can also happen from the bottom-up, thanks to calls to action from organizers and social media ratios. Artists and artworks are routinely taken to task for their insensitivity. In this new world order, artists, critics, philanthropists, galleries and museums alike are recalibrating their efforts to increase the visibility of marginalized voices and respond to the people's demands for better ethics in art. But what should we, the people, do with this newfound power? With exclusive interviews with Nan Goldin, Dana Schutz, Sam Durant, Faith Ringgold, and others, Nayeri tackles wide-ranging issues including sex, religion, gender, ethics, animal rights, and race. By asking and answering questions such as: Who gets to make art and who owns it? How do we correct the inequities of the past? What does authenticity, exploitation, and appropriation mean in art?, Takedown provides the necessary tools to navigate the art world.",1662600550,Takedown Art in the Age of Cancel Culture
377,With(Stan)ding Cancel Culture,Stan Twitter and Reactionary Fandoms,Hailey Roos,"Cancel culture is often regarded as a witch hunt on social media, a way to harass people into silence, an excuse to bully critics - but that was not always the case. This analysis traces the history of cancel culture, its appropriation by stans, and its rebirth as the commonly known petty, polarized behavior on Twitter. Cancel culture began on Black Twitter via callouts directed at public officials or celebrities for being racist, homophobic, sexist, etc. in an attempt to shed light on the abuse of power, to boycott corrupt companies, or to revoke support for problematic authority or celebrity figures. The social justice logic and activism behind cancel culture has been appropriated by Stan Twitter which is an obsessive, overzealous group of pop culture fans. Stans noticed the power that cancel culture had to end careers, twisted the activism into harassment, and restructured cancel culture as an excuse to censor anyone who questions, competes with, or critiques their idols. Today, cancel culture is viewed negatively because of the deeply negative effect of Stan Twitter had on this originally well-intentioned movement. This current version of cancel culture is almost always seen as an obstacle in the way of real progress in social justice activism. These two phenomena - cancel culture and stan Twitter - are the seeds of polarized behavior that have been planted in social media and that implicitly affect the ways that Twitter users respond to and make sense of the world in general.",OCLC:1242938373,With(Stan)ding Cancel Culture Stan Twitter and Reactionary Fandoms

385,Cancel This Book,The Progressive Case Against Cancel Culture,Dan Kovalik,"Examining a phenomenon that is sweeping the country, Cancel This Book shines the spotlight on the suppression of open and candid debate. The public shaming of individuals for actual or perceived offenses, often against emerging notions of proper racial and gender norms and relations, has become commonplace. In a number of cases, the shaming is accompanied by calls for the offending individuals to lose their jobs, positions, or other status. Frequently, those targeted for “cancellation” simply do not know the latest, ever-changing norms (often related to language) that they are accused of transgressing—or they have honest questions about issues that have been deemed off-limits for debate and discussion. Cancel This Book offers a unique perspective from Dan Kovalik, a progressive author who supports the ongoing movements for racial and gender equality and justice, but who is concerned about the prevalence of “cancelling” people, and especially of people who are well-intentioned and who are themselves allied with these movements. While many progressives believe that “cancelling” others is a form of activism and holding others accountable, Cancel This Book argues that “cancellation” is oftentimes counter-productive and destructive of the very values which the “cancellers” claim to support. And indeed, we now see instances in the workplace where employers are using this spirt of “cancellation” to pit employees against each other, to exert more control over the workforce and to undermine worker and labor solidarity. Kovalik observes that many progressives are quietly opposed to this “Cancel Culture” and to many instances of “cancellation” they witness, but they are afraid to air these concerns publicly lest they themselves be “cancelled.” The result is the suppression of open debate about important issues involving racial and gender matters, and even issues related to how to best confront the current COVID-19 pandemic. While people speak in whispers about their true feelings about such issues, critical debate and discussion is avoided, resentments build, and the movement for justice and equality is ultimately disserved.",9781510764996,Cancel This Book The Progressive Case Against Cancel Culture

The infamous “Harper’s Letter,” signed by public intellectuals of both the left and right, sought to settle the matter and only caused greater division. Originating as a way for marginalized and disempowered people to take down more powerful abusers, often with the help of social media, cancel culture is seen by some as having gone “too far.” Adrienne maree brown, a respected cultural voice and a professional mediator, reframes the discussion for us, in a way that points to possible ways beyond the impasse. Most critiques of cancel culture come from outside the milieus that produce it, sometimes from even from its targets. Brown explores the question from a Black, queer, and feminist viewpoint that gently asks, how well does this practice serve us? Does it prefigure the sort of world we want to live in? And, if it doesn’t, how do we seek accountability and redress for harm in a way that reflects our values?",9781849354233,We Will Not Cancel Us And Other Dreams of Transformative Justice

They find some offense on every web page. The topic of alcohol triggers feelings of bad. Because your family tore apart thanks to your drunk dad. Topics like abuse will trigger so many. Because dad hit mom. He'll serve 5-20. They want protection from all the things that hurt. They'll stalk you offline and you might lose your shirt.

397,God and Cancel Culture,Standing Strong for the Truth,Stephen E. Strang,"FROM THE BEST-SELLING AUTHOR OF GOD AND DONALD TRUMP 64% of Americans believe cancel culture is a threat to their freedom. This book will help you realize the seriousness of the battle before us and illuminate the present circumstance for the purpose of doing good-to bring hope. It will document what is happening in our country, how believers can respond, and why we can look expectantly to the future. This is the time for neither religious fatalism nor political inaction. No matter how bad things get in the culture or in government, the Bible is true and God has plans and purposes we don''t understand-and in the end we win. Things are chaotic in America. Liberal policies are advancing. A rash of executive orders appears to be moving the nation closer to socialism and a one-world government. And conservatives, including many Christians, are being censored as never before. There''s even a term-cancel culture-which 64 percent of Americans believe poses a threat to their freedom, according to a Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll. (Among Republicans, that figure is even higher at 80 percent.) The term applies to all conservatives who oppose the politically correct crowd, but it''s part of a bigger effort to cancel Christianity and those who espouse biblical principles. It almost seems this is the beginning of the end and the Antichrist will appear at any time. You pick the cultural or political issue, and there likely is not even the semblance of widespread agreement. It seems that Christians are in an unprecedented season of fragmentation, potential division, and actual separation on many fronts. Instead of going forward, much of the church seems to be moving backward or standing still, waiting for what''s next. In some ways Christians cancel each other in debates over non-essentials. There is no going backward if we want to remain effective and engaged. Paul wrote that all things work together for those who are ""called according to His purpose"" (Rom. 8:28, MEV). That calling is active, purposeful, and energetic. We can take the initiative and move forward from where we are. The body of Christ is a big, diverse family, and we must choose to cheer one another on rather than get into circular firing squads. We are called to advance on every front. This book will assess and affirm the different approaches playing out. The body needs clarity and unity- and has little of both right now. Wounded armies want hope, focus, and encouragement. This book will not throw anyone overboard who is standing for the truth in some positive way. Rather, it will allow readers to look critically at the various approaches vying for our allegiance and attention here in the middle of 2021. In the course of this survey, we will find reason to affirm where people are fighting on the battlefield and validate the perspectives they bring. Featuring interviews with a cross section of leaders, this book will document what is happening in our country, how believers can respond, and why we can look to the future with hope. Even though things are bad, we must understand that conditions have been this bad or worse in the past and God always came through. He has plans and purposes we don''t understand. Christians must not lose heart. We must stand strong and not be intimidated. We must pray, and we must believe God for a great awakening. No matter how bad things get in the culture or in government, the Bible is true and ""all things work together for good to those who love God"" (Rom. 8:28, MEV). That''s because we are called according to His purpose. A purpose never goes in reverse. This book will reveal what that looks like in its various forms in the day in which we live. It gives a great handle for promoting unity and appreciation of one another when that is breaking down so badly elsewhere. Indeed, maybe the love Jesus spoke about that makes us recognizable to the world will be seen as this book illuminates the supernatural unity among people of very diverse opinions and approaches while pointedly addressing these various hot-button areas.",1636410626,God and Cancel Culture Standing Strong for the Truth

These dissenters have paid or are paying the price for expressing unpopular ideas that put them in jeopardy, because they don't uphold a prevailing status quo, but go against the grain, contradicting or antagonizing others in their professional, political, or social circle, often triggering backlash, punishment, cruelty, loss, and ostracization. Like other dissenters before them, they have faced their fears to buck and challenge those who to want to shut them up, and in so doing they make the world more interesting and the conversation richer. They help illustrate the real value and meaning of true dissent and its critical role in tempering positions, speaking truth to power, balancing debate, and helping the center to hold.",0578607832,

Stop whining. Stop playing defense. Stop living like the world, and start being different. Strong. Powerful. Set apart unto the Lord. God has called us to be holy. We are not called to be like the culture. Jesus has commissioned us to reach the culture for Him. But we can’t do that by looking, sounding, and acting just like the culture. While the culture has sought to cancel Christians and Christianity, the truth is that we should have canceled many things about the world’s culture a long time ago. We have to break the strongholds of culture’s influence over us as a holy people. Bishop Eric Lambert is a Senior Pastor, a Presiding Bishop, and host of the Christian television show Climbing Higher. In Cancel the Culture, Bishop Lambert will exhort you with a different challenge for every month of the year: · Be different on social media · Pull away from the spirit of materialism · Rid yourself of the influence of pornographic material · Get free of the deceptive trap of the world’s entertainment · Pursue unity over division · Protect yourself and loved ones from dark forces in online gaming · Avoid the pitfalls of secular education · Overcome the largely ignored sin of gluttony · Understand and pursue true holiness · Stop idolizing Christian leaders · Move past treating church like a social club · Make sure you aren’t substituting religion for a relationship with the One True God We are not going to reach the culture if we are living just like them.

From bad banks to global warming it can all look hopeless, but what if everything could turn out, well, even better than before? What if the only thing holding us back is a lack of imagination and a surplus of old orthodoxies? In fascinating and iconoclastic detail - on everything from the cash in your pocket to the food on your plate and the shape of our working lives - Cancel the Apocalypse describes how the relentless race for economic growth is not always one worth winning, how excessive materialism has come at a terrible cost to our environment, and hasn't even made us any happier in the process. Simms believes passionately in the human capacity for change, and shows how the good life remains in our grasp. While global warming and financial meltdown might feel like modern day horsemen of the apocalypse, Simms shows how such end of the world scenarios offer us the chance for a new beginning.",9780748119547,Cancel The Apocalypse The New Path To Prosperity

449,White Negroes,When Cornrows Were in Vogue and and Other Thoughts on Cultural Appropriation,Lauren Michele Jackson,"In White Negroes, cultural commentator, essayist, and scholar Lauren Michele Jackson explores trends started in Black communities that have caught on and become cool, hugely popular and lucrative, but that exclude Black communities once mainstream audiences and mainstream dollars latch on. The consequences of this phenomenon can be easy to miss, as it is so ingrained in our consumer habits. Yet over and over, Black intellectual property is converted into white profit - one hashtag, hair style, music genre, and dance move at a time. This, Jackson argues, plays a role in keeping Black people from achieving economic, political, and social equity. Weaving together media scholarship and cultural critique, Jackson re-situates cultural appropriation as more than just a new buzzword. It is, she contends, simply another chapter in the long history of whiteness thriving at the expense, stolen labor and ingenuity of Black people. Further, her interrogation and exposure of the interracial antagonism resting on the other side of appropriation unravels behavior that feels normal only because it is common. Piercing, audacious, and bursting with pop-culture touchstones, White Negroes introduces a bold new voice in Jackson. Her debut is both a love letter to the creativity of Black folks and an urgent call for more thoughtful consumption by those who consider themselves ""allies.""",9780807011805,White Negroes When Cornrows Were in Vogue and and Other Thoughts on Cultural Appropriation

455,"Rap Music and Cultural Appropriation in Hari Kunzru's ""White Tears""",,Florian Arleth,"Academic Paper from the year 2018 in the subject Literature - Modern Literature, grade: 1,7, University of Heidelberg (Anglistisches Seminar), course: PS II Race and Racism in Contemporary American Literature, language: English, abstract: This term paper takes a look at how cultural appropriation works in the context of African-American music in general and rap music in particular. Relevant parts of Hari Kunzru's novel ""White Tears"" will be analyzed in order to understand the motivations and intentions that the two white twenty somethings have in their respective approaches to music that was made before they were born and to a subculture they never participated in due to their social backgrounds. The conclusion of this term paper then answers the following question: Was Carter right to reject the white rapper's business proposal? Especially in a society like the United States with its long history of racial and cultural contacts and clashes, the appropriation of items from different cultural backgrounds is a strongly contested issue. The intensity of recent mainstream debates concerning the professional sport franchises of the Cleveland Indians or the Washington Redskins and their respective marketing of Native American culture is proof of that. When cultural appropriation is used as a vehicle of capitalism, it becomes debatable. Hari Kunzru's novel ""White Tears"", published in 2017, deals with exactly these topics when portraying the business ventures of two young white music producers and their shared search for vintage sound in modern day New York City. In an early scene of the book, Seth and Carter, the producer duo, meet with representatives of a major label and their artist, a famous white rapper. Having heard of their vast archives of rare vintage sounds and their classic methods of production, the mainstream artists offers them the opportunity to work on his newest project, a tribute to all African-American music that was recorded prior to his birth in the Nineties. When Carter dismisses the project on the grounds of false cultural appropriation, he leaves his business partner as confused as the reader of the novel, since there is no further explanation offered and the plot continues.",9783668972148,
457,The Polish Wild West,"Forced Migration and Cultural Appropriation in the Polish-German Borderlands, 1945-1948",Beata Halicka,"The incorporation of German territories east of the Oder and Western Neisse rivers into Poland in 1945 was linked with the difficult process of an almost total exchange of population and involved the taking over of a region in which the Second World War had effected an enormous level of destruction. The contemporary term ‘Polish Wild West’ not only alluded to the reigning atmosphere of chaos and ‘survival of the fittest’ in the Polish–German borderland but was also associated with a new kind of freedom and the opportunity to start everything anew. The arrival in this region of Polish settlers from different parts of Poland led to Poles, Germans and Soviet soldiers temporarily coming into contact with one another. Living together in this war-damaged space was far from easy. On the basis of ego-documents, the author recreates the beginnings of the shaping of this new society, one affected by a repressive political system, internal conflicts and human tragedy. In distancing oneself from the until-recently dominant narratives concerning expellees in Germany or pioneers of the ‘Recovered Territories’ in Poland, Beata Halicka tells the story of the disintegration of a previous cultural landscape and the establishment of one which was new, in a colourful and vivid manner and encompassing different points of view.",9781000060058,"The Polish Wild West Forced Migration and Cultural Appropriation in the Polish-German Borderlands, 1945-1948"

469,The Cultural Life of Intellectual Properties,"Authorship, Appropriation, and the Law",Rosemary J. Coombe,"Logos, trademarks, national insignia, brand names, celebrity images, design patents, and advertising texts are vibrant signs in a consumer culture governed by a regime of intellectual property laws. In The Cultural Life of Intellectual Properties, professor of law and cultural anthropologist Rosemary J. Coombe brings an illuminating ethnographic approach to an analysis of authorship and the role law plays in shaping the various meanings that animate these protected properties in the public sphere. Although such artifacts are ubiquitous in contemporary culture, little attention has been paid to the impact of intellectual property law in everyday life or to how ownership of specific intellectual properties is determined and exercised. Drawing on a wide range of cases, disputes, and local struggles, Coombe examines these issues and dismantles the legal assumption that the meaning and value of a text or image is produced exclusively by an individual author or that authorship has a single point of origin. In the process, she examines controversies that include the service of turbanned Sikhs in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the use of the term Olympic in reference to the proposed gay Olympic Games. Other chapters discuss the appropriation of such celebrity images as the Marx brothers, Judy Garland, Dolly Parton, James Dean, and Luke Skywalker; the conflict over team names such as the Washington Redskins; and the opposition of indigenous peoples to stereotypical Native American insignia proffered by the entertainment industry. Ultimately, she makes a case for redefining the political in commodified cultural environments. Significant for its insights into the political significance of current intellectual property law, this book also provides new perspectives on debates in cultural anthropology, cultural studies, and political theory. It will therefore interest both a wide scholarly and a general audience.",9780822382492,"The Cultural Life of Intellectual Properties Authorship, Appropriation, and the Law"

The result is an innovative and nuanced investigation of Roman cultural appropriation and imperial power.",1108310915,"Rome, Empire of Plunder The Dynamics of Cultural Appropriation"

Excerpt: The Cleveland Indians are a professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. They are in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's American League. Since 1994, they have played in what is now Progressive Field. The team's spring training facility is at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Arizona. Since their establishment as a Major League franchise in 1901, the Indians have won two World Series championships, in 1920 and 1948. The ""Indians"" name originates from a request by the club owner to decide on a new name, following the 1914 season. In reference to the Boston Braves (now the Atlanta Braves), the media chose ""the Indians."" Common nicknames for the Indians include the ""Tribe"" and the ""Wahoos,"" the latter being a reference to their logo, Chief Wahoo. The mascot is called Slider. The Cleveland team originated in 1900 as the Lake Shores, when the American League (AL) was officially a minor league. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the major league incarnation of the club was founded in Cleveland in 1901.

485,Hybrid Cultures,Solutions for Cultural Appropriation in Art,,"Cultural Appropriation is a phenomenon that has taken part of the art world for generations. Though there are discussions within many fields about this, a sense of combativeness remains. The idea of US vs. THEM has been an issue since racial inequality has taken part in our country. Thus, how can one approach such a deep-seeded and extremely sensitive subject in a constructive way? Through research and active participation in cultural education, artists and historians can better come to understand how cultural appropriation takes the stage from minorities whilst keeping them oppressed. This study aims to present the communities of art history and art practice with solutions on how to approach the subject of culture and race in a respectful manner. Through extensive research on the countries of South Korea, Mexico, and the United States, the Hybrid Cultures collection presents the audience with works created through collaboration of cultures, as well as an expansive background on how such was approached and done.",OCLC:1230502790,Hybrid Cultures Solutions for Cultural Appropriation in Art
486,A Lesson from the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 about Cultural Appropriation and Tribal Sovereignty,What Sana Clara Pueblo Can Do to Protect Tewa Cultural Property,Patrick Victor Naranjo,"This article advocates for the development of American Indian tribal legislation as a focal point, regardless of jurisdiction limitations to protect cultural property, focusing in particular on the problem presented in this project through the active appropriation of sacred Tewa ceremonies. By drawing a contrast to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, in which the various Pueblo villages coordinated a successful rebellion to expel Spanish missionaries, the article urges Tewa governments and other American Indian tribes to draw on their long history of religious oppression to formulate modern tribal laws to protect against religious and cultural appropriation. Protection of cultural property is essential for American Indian tribes because cultural knowledge, practices, and ceremonial items are central to tribal identity and religious beliefs. Cultural properties also form the basis for tribal sovereignty as it is recognized by the U.S. government today. These ceremonies are the binding social structures for indigenous communities and kinship that establish the sovereign capacity in which they operate and the authority of indigenous legal claims. The appropriation of these ceremonies directly threatens Tewa survival. It facilitates harmful misuse and misunderstanding of the life-affirming rituals through which the Tewa people ensure their continued existence. It also threatens to erode the cultural and religious distinctions on which the tribal-federal relationship is based. At a representative level, it erases Tewa tribal identity, replacing it with historicized representations of Indians in popular culture. This thesis focuses on explaining why the organized protection of Native American cultural properties must be a paramount concern for modern tribal governments. My primary audience is modern tribal leaders. Faced with a wide variety of governmental concerns, including economic development, land management, natural resource management, and administration of social welfare programs, tribal leaders today do not always prioritize protection of cultural properties.",OCLC:872416748,A Lesson from the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 about Cultural Appropriation and Tribal Sovereignty What Sana Clara Pueblo Can Do to Protect Tewa Cultural Property

494,"Imagining Them, Reimagining Ourselves",A Case Study of Cultural Appropriation and the Politics of Identity,Mary K. Smith-Nolan,"Several popular cultural movements emphasizing indigenous spirituality have arisen in the United States and Europe within the past thirty years. Spiritual discourses attributed to Native Americans, among other groups, are borrowed by Euro-Americans in search of alternatives to dominant ideologies. In such a circumstance, Native Americans become part of a constructed and colonized homogenous category of indigenous people, considered by Euro-Americans as naturally close to the earth and essentially spiritual. The so-called New Age movement has, within it, several sub-movements, which are particularly noted for their emphasis on perceived Native American spiritualism. The Red Cedar Circle, made up primarily of white Americans, focuses on the Si.si.wiss Medicine of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and can be described as falling under the definitional heading of the New Age. The suppression and transformation of the heterogeneous reality of indigenous societies by the imaginings of the Euro-American dominant, has many ethical implications, as does cultural appropriation in a situation of major power differentials. Native communities are becoming increasingly outspoken in their opposition to the practice of Indian, or pseudo-Indian, religions by non-Natives. Many consider such practices to be morally suspect. Both Native and non-Native social critics feel that New Age practitioners involved in appropriated and popularized versions of indigenous religions, are interpreting and using aspects of traditionally subjugated cultures to meet their own needs. What may appear to be a harmless search for enlightenment by Europeans and Euro-Americans might have very real negative consequences for actual Native American lives. This study is based on participant observation of the Corvallis, Oregon Red Cedar Circle, and interviews with its members from June of 1991 to April of 1994. Analysis of data from New Age literature was also conducted, as well as an historical overview of the 'Nobel Savage' myth in Western cultures. Interviews with members of the local Native American community were carried out for feedback on how a given population of Native Americans perceives the Euro-American practice of Native spirituality. The data supports the supposition that cultural borrowing, or appropriation, is both a cause of, and a reaction to, the instability of cultural identity in late twentieth-century America.",OCLC:36946615,"Imagining Them, Reimagining Ourselves A Case Study of Cultural Appropriation and the Politics of Identity"

It considers theoretical, research, practice, and activist perspectives; and outlines a basis for good practice when working with non-binary individuals. The first section provides an overview of historical, legal and academic aspects of this phenomenon. The second section explores how psychotherapeutic, psychological and psychiatric theory and practice are adapting to a non-binary model of gender, and the third section considers the body related aspects, from endocrinology to surgery. This work will appeal to a wide readership, from practitioners working with non-binary individuals - including psychologists, surgeons, social workers, nurses, psychiatrists, endocrinologists, psychotherapists and counselors, lawyers, and healthcare workers - to researchers interested in the study of gender identities, to students and gender activists.",9781137510532,
501,Non-binary and Genderqueer Genders,,Motmans Joz,"Some people have a gender which is neither male nor female and may identify as both male and female at one time, as different genders at different times, as no gender at all, or dispute the very idea of only two genders. The most often heard umbrella terms for such genders are ‘non-binary’ or ‘genderqueer’ genders. This book looks to bring together those currently exploring and researching this non-binary phenomenon. Gender identities outside of the binary of female and male are increasingly being recognized in social, legal, medical and psychological discourses together with the emerging presence and advocacy of people, who identify as non-binary or genderqueer. Population-based studies show a small percentage – but a sizable proportion in terms of numbers – of people who identify as non-binary. While such genders have always been in existence worldwide, they remain marginalized, and as such at risk of victimization and of minority stress as a result of social non-acceptance and discrimination. Non-binary and Genderqueer Genders explores these gender identities in relation to health, well-being, and/or other experiences in an effort to contribute to improving clinical standards and continued cultural change towards acceptance for this group of people. This book was originally published as a special issue of the International Journal of Transgenderism (renamed International Journal of Transgender Health in 2020).",9781000053326,
503,Casting a Queer Circle: Non-binary Witchcraft,,Thista Minai,"Many people come to traditional Wicca or Witchcraft seeking the benefits of shared ritual, spiritual community, and formalized training, but the inherent sex and gender binaries that permeate modern Wicca can make anyone who exists outside of that polarity feel unimportant or excluded. Even people who identify within a gender binary but want their spiritual or religious practice to reflect a spectrum of life experiences can feel stifled and smothered in the biases of Wicca-based Paganism. Thista Minai has created an alternative. Casting a Queer Circle describes Spectrum Gate Mysteries, a new ritual system conceived as a direct answer to those of us who appreciate the wisdom and power of traditional Wicca, yet need something more inclusive. Here you'll find the fundamentals of queering witchcraft, from casting a Circle and celebrating the Wheel of the Year, to Rites of Passage and creating a coven.

Our gender identity is impacted by our personal histories; the cultures, communities and countries we are born into; and the places we go and the people we meet. But the representation of contemporary non-binary identities has been limited, until now.

Leading non-binary people share stories of their intersecting lives; how it feels to be non-binary and neurodiverse, the challenges of being a non-binary pregnant person, what it means to be non-binary within the Quaker community, the joy of reaching gender euphoria.

515,"Trans and non-binary gender healthcare for psychiatrists, psychologists, and other health professionals",,Christina Richards,"""People who are not content to remain the gender they were assigned at birth have existed throughout human history and in all recorded cultures (Herdt, 1996). Naturally the experiences of people in the contemporary high-income cultures which are the focus of this book will be informed by the understandings and technology available now, but fundamentally gender diversity is not a new phenomenon. It is therefore curious that, until recently, it was commonly thought that gender diversity was so rare that it would not trouble most psychiatrists or psychologists in their usual course of work. This is no longer the case, as there has recently been an exponential increase in the number of gender diverse people coming forward, which mirrors that of same-sex-attracted people a couple of decades before. Most likely this is once again due to the greater, although still tenuous, social acceptance being shown towards sexual and gender diversity in some countries. It follows therefore that psychiatrists and others will have seen gender diverse people throughout their careers, but without necessarily being aware that they were doing so""--",9781108703024,

While binary success/failure analyses are common, McCann and Li (CNS Neurosci Ther 2012; 18: 414–418) introduced “number of beyond-threshold weeks of success” (NOBWOS) scores to avoid dichotomized outcomes. NOBWOS scoring employs an efficacy “hurdle” with values reflecting duration of success. Here, we evaluate NOBWOS scores rigorously. Formal analysis of mathematical structure of NOBWOS scores is followed by simulation studies spanning diverse conditions to assess operating characteristics of five linear-rank tests on NOBWOS scores. Simulations include assessment of Fisher’s exact test applied to hurdle component. On average, statistical power was approximately equal for five linear-rank tests. Under none of conditions examined did Fisher’s exact test exhibit greater statistical power than any of the linear-rank tests. These linear-rank tests provide good Type I and Type II error control for comparing distributions of NOBWOS scores between groups (e.g. active vs. placebo). All methods were applied to re-analyses of data from four clinical trials of differing lengths and substances of abuse. These linear-rank tests agreed across all trials in rejecting (or not) their null (equality of distributions) at ≤ 0.05.",OCLC:1053725350,

567,Understanding Trans and Non-binary Individuals' Needs in a Therapeutic Context,A Workshop for Therapists Working with Trans/non-binary Clients,Sam Sawyer Silverman,"Most transgender (trans) and non-binary individuals face tremendous challenges accessing quality mental health services. Trans people and non-binary people identify with a gender other than the one associated with the sex assigned to them at birth (Erickson-Schroth, 2014). The Williams Institute (2011) estimates that there are approximately 1.4 million trans people in the US, and over 75% of them seek therapy (Budge, Katz-Wise, Tebbe, Schneider, and Rodriquez, 2013). However, Bidell (2005) finds that few therapists receive any information at all about working with trans or non-binary clients. In fact, most therapists receive no training on working with trans/non-binary clients in their schools, traineeships, or internships and go on to become supervisors and teachers who do not train their supervisees (Bidell, 2005). As a result, Budge et al. (2013) find that many trans/non-binary individuals either fear harassment upon coming to therapy, have negative experiences when they come to therapy, or both. The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) (2012) holds therapists to a set of ethical guidelines. One guideline is for therapists to avoid discrimination, specifically including discrimination based on gender identity. However, they also require that therapists do not practice outside of their scope of competence (AAMFT, 2012). As a result, therapists must educate themselves about trans individuals until systemic change can occur to include discussion of therapy with trans/non-binary clients as a standard part of training. This paper outlines a workshop created to address this disparity of knowledge and the limited availability of trans-friendly therapeutic care. This workshop will combine three elements: a lecture on research (terminology, challenges trans people face, standards of care, protective factors), a panel of trans individuals (to allow therapists to confront biases/misinformation and to provide trans people a platform to speak about their needs and experiences that therapists can hear), and a vignette with discussion groups (where therapists will get a chance to put into practice the knowledge they have gained). The workshop will also provide therapists with essential resources for trans people in their community and to assist themselves and their colleagues in learning more about therapeutic work with trans clients.",OCLC:1249031442,Understanding Trans and Non-binary Individuals' Needs in a Therapeutic Context A Workshop for Therapists Working with Trans/non-binary Clients

These are not the familiar clashes between liberals and conservatives or the religious and the secular: instead, they are clashes between a new moral culture—victimhood culture—and a more traditional culture of dignity. Even as students increasingly demand trigger warnings and “safe spaces,” many young people are quick to police the words and deeds of others, who in turn claim that political correctness has run amok. Interestingly, members of both camps often consider themselves victims of the other. In tracking the rise of victimhood culture, Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning help to decode an often dizzying cultural milieu, from campus riots over conservative speakers and debates around free speech to the election of Donald Trump.",9783319703299,"The Rise of Victimhood Culture Microaggressions, Safe Spaces, and the New Culture Wars"

Although cross-racial casting has been the topic of heated discussion, little sustained scholarship addresses both the historical precedents and theoretical dimensions. Pao illustrates the tensions and contradictions inherent not only in stage representations, but also in the performance of race in everyday life. A wonderful book whose potential readership goes well beyond theater and performance scholars."" ---Josephine Lee, University of Minnesota ""Non-traditional casting, increasingly practiced in American theater, is both deeply connected to our country's racial self-image(s) and woefully under-theorized. Pao takes on the practice in its entirety to disentangle the various strands of this vitally important issue."" ---Karen Shimakawa, New York University No Safe Spaces looks at one of the most radical and enduring changes introduced during the Civil Rights era---multiracial and cross-racial casting practices in American theater. The move to cast Latino/a, African American, and Asian American actors in classic stage works by and about white Europeans and Americans is viewed as both social and political gesture and artistic innovation. Nontraditionally cast productions are shown to have participated in the national dialogue about race relations and ethnic identity and served as a source of renewed creativity for the staging of the canonical repertory. Multiracial casting is explored first through its history, then through its artistic, political, and pragmatic dimensions. Next, the book focuses on case studies from the dominant genres of contemporary American theater: classical tragedy and comedy, modern domestic drama, antirealist drama, and the Broadway musical, using a broad array of archival source materials to enhance and illuminate its arguments.

Students lashing out at any speaker brave enough to say something they disagree with. Precious snow flakes demanding “Safe Spaces” to protect them from any idea they haven’t heard from their liberal professors. In this book and the accompanying movie, Dennis Prager, Mark Joseph, and Adam Carolla expose the attack on free speech and free thought. It began in the universities, but—fair warning—it’s coming to your neighborhood and your workplace. “No Safe Spaces is a film every American should see. I could barely move when it was over. Powerful, emotional, and a call to action for anyone worried about the intellectual fascism happening in this country. A brave, timely, and important film.” —MEGYN KELLY, former FOX News anchor and host of Megyn Kelly Today “There is no free speech in America for free thinkers! You can have free speech in America but only if you say what everybody else agrees with. It’s not enough to ‘live and let live’ now. The psycho-elite believe ‘silence is violence’ and you must actively promote what THEY want no matter how vile or reprehensible it is to you. George Orwell lives!

It exhibits an impressive scholarly achievement, capturing and combining the insights of both established academics and emerging researchers. Each author succeeds in distilling the knowledge of their particular fields of interest, as well as conveying the essence of their intuitive understanding and the richness of the context. This book considers a variety of connected content and methodological issues in three major sections: ‘Philosophical and policy perspectives’, ‘Gender discourses: diverse perspectives’ and ‘Discourses on narratives as safe spaces’. The Edition is further strengthened by allowing international reviewers the opportunity of engaging with the contributors in the Introduction and Conclusion, an innovative departure from conventional formats and which will provide a global perspective to the readers. The focus of the various chapters succeeds in establishing both a foundation and platform for dialogue surrounding human rights and human rights education in modern policy and governance. Aptly named “Safe Spaces”, the Edition offers in-depth and credible (“safe”) nuances (“spaces”), in terms of the somewhat reified concept of human rights, at a time when human rights remains a highly topical and contested international issue. As such, the book imparts an immense scope of theoretical and empirical perspectives, reflected by the distinguished intellectuals who navigate the terrain of their respective disciplines with profound erudition.

591,?Safe? Spaces?,Vegan Ideologies and Farm Animal Sanctuaries,Angela Dawn Parker,"Farm animal sanctuaries in North America are spaces that have been created by humans who want to provide refuge for farm animals who are not normally considered to be companion animals. Within these ostensibly safe spaces, humans and the rescued animals can develop a relationship similar to human-human friendship. These spaces may be free of violence, but humans still control the animals, thus limiting the choices of the non-humans and reinforcing hierarchical relations (Emel, et al., 2015). Are sanctuaries safe spaces? What is a safe space for domesticated animals? Do safe spaces exist? To answer these questions, this thesis is an exploratory study of two farm animal sanctuaries in Eastern Ontario. Because the concept of safe spaces for animals is novel in the academic literature, this thesis builds from existing definitions of safe spaces for humans: spaces that are free of control, protected from outside society and places where unspoken hierarchies can be challenged (Evans & Boyt, 1992; Gamson, 1996; Roestone Collective, 2014). The thesis also draws on a modified version of Rhoda Wilkie’s (2005) concept of ?attached attachment?, linking this concept to vegan ideologies and placing impartialness towards sentient beings at one end of the spectrum and emotional concern at the other end. Wilkie’s farmer-animal associations are employed using a slightly different angle, questioning if animal sanctuaries can be considered safe spaces if volunteers do not exhibit an ?attached attachment? with the animals. Using theoretical insights developed in the field of sociology, geography, environmental studies and ethology, this research will contribute to animal geography as a grounded perspective on farm sanctuaries and safe spaces, two topics that have been largely overlooked. The findings of this research describe farm animal sanctuaries and the people who care for the animals within these spaces. The research finds that vegan ideologies tend to play a role in the foundations of sanctuaries; however, they do not shape all sanctuary spaces. The research also finds that farm sanctuaries may be free of violence, but the animals are still controlled by humans. The safeness is limited at sanctuaries due to the hierarchical divide. This thesis concludes that farm animal sanctuaries are indeed safe spaces for animals, but with limitations.",OCLC:1114285927,?Safe? Spaces? Vegan Ideologies and Farm Animal Sanctuaries
592,The Comfort Zone and Other Safe Spaces,,Tom Over,"We live in anxious times, you and I, desperately uncertain times. An era in which governments behave irrationally. Diseases ravage the populous. And internet culture threatens to change who we really are. Modern life, for many, is one giant trigger warning. You need a place of sanctuary, a refuge from the chaos - so follow me now, into The Comfort Zone and Other Safe Spaces. In the Zone nothing is what it seems. Houses defy the laws of nature while bodies become portals to impossible worlds. Viruses harbour mystifying enigmas and technologies incite the most subversive of desires. Unfathomable encounters lurk both beneath the waves and between the stars. Even birth and death, once knowable certainties, are here warped beyond all recognition. In his debut collection, Tom Over pushes the boundaries of genre storytelling into startling new realms. From transgressive weird fiction to 80s-inspired splatterpunk, from surreal dreamscapes to body horror nightmares. Exploring both earthbound fears and uncharted cosmic terror, these stories will lure you into spaces that, upon inspection, may prove not safe after all... - ""Tom Over shows no bounds in how far he's willing to go with the absurd and grotesque and I love him for it. He is a tightrope walker of a writer, balancing horror and pitch black humour with literary flare. Reading this book was the most fun I've had in a while. I loved these stories.

595,Seeking Safe Spaces,The Impact of Campus Climate on College Choice,Billy J. Hensley,"This study examined the methods and markers queer students use to evaluate a university climate as an outsider during the admission process as well as the means they use to become a member of a particular campus community. The multifaceted results of this dissertation highlight students' exploration of the complex notion of safety as a method of interpersonal discovery as well as a process for choosing specific campus spaces. Particularly, the time these students spent choosing a college, as well as the time they spent in relationship with the college campus climate, demonstrated the significant social and psychological impact a campus has upon the students that enroll. The findings of this study highlight particular assertions that demonstrate: that students construct means for feeling safe to hide, explore, and express their sexual orientation on campus; that LGBTQ students often keep part of their authentic selves out of relationships in order to retain the relationships that are available to them; and an emergent discussion that highlights that the inability to find self and be authentic in the classroom has significant impacts on learning. By using qualitative and action research methods, this study was able to highlight queer students' subjective characterizations of safety and how it allowed them a broad range of possibilities-from an environment's ability to encourage a student to hide their sexuality to the opposite extreme that allows for an open exploration of sexuality. This research also emphasizes the impact made on student learning, social development, and relational competence. Specifically, for students to experience the full and broad impact of the college campus, there must be a two-way expression of thoughts and feelings where everyone's experience is broadened and deepened. This work also demonstrates that while some students, despite a negative environment, do find resilience and relationships in certain spaces on campus, many students, due to the obstacles highlighted in this study, are unable to navigate the path toward finding positive, inclusive academic and campus connections. If students have spaces that are safe-where queer students are openly accepted-then they will not have to spend so much effort creating and finding safe spaces. The data presented in this study demonstrate the impact of safety not only on college choice but also on the ability to authentically integrate into a campus climate. The implications of this work underscore the power of, and need for, well thought out and inclusive space; fundamentally, safe spaces come about when they are designed by a broad range of LGBTQ students that fully represent inclusive voices-when people reexamine what they think we know about safety, they then find the means to construct safe space that serves all members of the community.",OCLC:428979333,Seeking Safe Spaces The Impact of Campus Climate on College Choice

And most importantly, how can we build schools worthy of our children? From the time children are little, we start making stories about them. Schools are like factories where these stories are manufactured all the time. Some children, who're at the top of the social hierarchy, enjoy rich, diverse and colourful stories, which are told and retold. But there are many who spend most of their lives in school, clutching on to single, thin narratives where they've been judged as: 'a failure', 'can do better', 'not up to the mark' or 'not reaching potential' - every 'not' restricting and making their narratives thinner, limited, with lesser scope for possibilities. These are the children who are forgotten, who are invisible and who are seen as never being good enough. At the core of this book is a deep faith that learning is about the magical relationship the teacher builds with each child; it is about building emotionally safe, inclusive spaces for creative learning - this is the heart, the lifeblood, the bare bones of learning. Imagine is a call to action for teachers, parents, counsellors, therapists, activists, thought leaders and other change agents in our society.

616,A Case Study on the Design of Safe Spaces in Hospitals Vulnerable to Tornadoes in Central US,,Lucy O. Ampaw-Asiedu,"In the wake of recent disasters happening around the world such as the earthquake in Italy (January 2017); hurricanes in the United States (U.S.) (September 2016 and 2017); and compounding disasters in Haiti (September 2010 and 2016); to our best knowledge, never has the world seen the need to work on preemptive rather than reactionary measures to address this issue. Tornadoes are natural hazards that commonly occur in mid-western and central states of the U.S. Tornadoes, like all natural hazards, are very destructive and result in massive destruction to building structures, causing billions of dollars in damage and claim many lives. Healthcare facilities in general are vulnerable to disasters and the safety of patients, health workers as well as those who come in to seek shelter should be a priority. This study assessed disaster management measures instituted by hospitals. Thus, the study examined building structure vulnerabilities and the design of safe spaces in hospitals within central U.S. Objectives that guided the work involved identifying the impact of tornadoes in hospitals and assessing the structural design of safe spaces. St. John’s Regional Medical Center, now Mercy Hospital in Joplin, was used as a case study as a point of comparison pointing out structural performance from the 2011 event. The study revealed that incorporating construction materials outlined by FEMA and designing safe zones according to high-winds capacity is vital for reducing vulnerability to disasters in healthcare facilities. Findings led to a proposed structural design of an interior hallway/corridor safe space for healthcare facilities.",OCLC:1049711288,

The analysis demonstrates the need for further research to identify stronger representation of spaces for queer people of color to increase access of resources and quality of life. Recommendations from this analysis results in an new index tool and identifies supporting practices that generate innovation for a multifaceted approach in planning. This approach contributes to stronger economics, equity, and environmental considerations for city growth.

621,Institutionally Designated Safe Spaces,Understanding How Black Students Utilize and Experience These Spaces to Develop a Sense of Belonging,Emil Cunningham,"This paper explores the lived experiences of twelve self-identified Black students at Middle State University (Middle State), a predominantly White institution (PWI). This research focused on understanding how institutionally designated safe spaces (IDSS) helped Black students develop a sense of belonging after experiencing a negative campus racial incident (NCRI). Using Hurtado, Milem, Clayton-Pederson, and Allen's (1999) campus racial climate model as a theoretical framework, this study developed a model to represent how Black students who utilize an IDSS to develop a sense of belonging with the broader campus community do so in concert with their engagement in both the academic and co-curricular realm. This research discovered that though NCRIs had an immediate effect on participants, it did not rise to a threshold that would diminish their ability to develop a sense of belonging, nor did it enhance or reduce their level of engagement with the IDSS. Additionally, it was discovered that Black students participating in this study attributed their development of a sense of belonging to the ability of a specific areas (IDSS, curricular, or co-curricular) to meet their individual needs related to belonging.",OCLC:915618736,Institutionally Designated Safe Spaces Understanding How Black Students Utilize and Experience These Spaces to Develop a Sense of Belonging

Hidalgo,"Abstract: This thesis is an ethnographic study of food truck vendors in Phoenix, Arizona that shows the lived realities of Mexican migrant entrepreneurs, including their struggles and their successes. Although many consider food vending a marginal profession, I argue that these vendors play a critical role in the local economy by creating opportunities for families and extended networks to accumulate wealth and upward mobility. I also illustrate how these entrepreneurs conceptualize success, believing their enterprises are crucial to immigrants' struggles because they provide goods and services to racially segregated communities. Further, by comparing and contrasting different types of food truck vendors I show how political activism and community organizing can lead to greater economic success. Ultimately, this thesis shows that despite strict immigration policies, migrant entrepreneurs in Phoenix have claimed their own public space that provides a safe haven for migrants seeking a better future in the United States.",1303019906,"""Tacos!, Burritos!, Tortas!""

The discussion of gender norms and its impact on individuals as well as society is an increasingly popular and reoccurring discussion within communities worldwide. The conception of a binary gender model as the norm is in the process of a general reconstruction. As the World Health Organization defines gender as a reference to ""the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men"" it sheds light to the widening of the human awareness and social impact within a society. This paper will cover a short introduction to the term gender fluidity within its general notion, providing an overview of the topic at hand and creating an uninterrupted connection to Ali Smith's book ""Girl meets boy"", discussed in Chapter two. In this chapter I will outline the different ways in which gender fluidity is presented in the story and show how Ali Smith finds methods to express this topic.",9783346093356,
640,Haunted Bauhaus,"Occult Spirituality, Gender Fluidity, Queer Identities, and Radical Politics",Elizabeth Otto,"An investigation of the irrational and the unconventional currents swirling behind the Bauhaus's signature sleek surfaces and austere structures. The Bauhaus (1919-1933) is widely regarded as the twentieth century's most influential art, architecture, and design school, celebrated as the archetypal movement of rational modernism and famous for bringing functional and elegant design to the masses. In Haunted Bauhaus, art historian Elizabeth Otto liberates Bauhaus history, uncovering a movement that is vastly more diverse and paradoxical than previously assumed. Otto traces the surprising trajectories of the school's engagement with occult spirituality, gender fluidity, queer identities, and radical politics. The Bauhaus, she shows us, is haunted by these untold stories. The Bauhaus is most often associated with a handful of famous artists, architects, and designers--notably Paul Klee, Walter Gropius, L szl Moholy-Nagy, and Marcel Breuer. Otto enlarges this narrow focus by reclaiming the historically marginalized lives and accomplishments of many of the more than 1,200 Bauhaus teachers and students (the so-called Bauh usler), arguing that they are central to our understanding of this movement. Otto reveals Bauhaus members' spiritual experimentation, expressed in double-exposed ""spirit photographs"" and enacted in breathing exercises and nude gymnastics; their explorations of the dark sides of masculinity and emerging female identities; the ""queer hauntology"" of certain Bauhaus works; and the role of radical politics on both the left and the right--during the school's Communist period, when some of the Bauh usler put their skills into the service of the revolution, and, later, into the service of the Nazis. With Haunted Bauhaus, Otto not only expands our knowledge of a foundational movement of modern art, architecture, and design, she also provides the first sustained investigation of the irrational and the unconventional currents swirling behind the Bauhaus's signature sleek surfaces and austere structures. This is a fresh, wild ride through the Bauhaus you thought you knew.",0262043297,"Haunted Bauhaus Occult Spirituality, Gender Fluidity, Queer Identities, and Radical Politics"

Sometimes to serve as 'go-betweens' to bring lovers together, sometimes to stand in for a missing wife, and sometimes to nurse a sick devotee. Not all queer stories are sexual but they do challenge notions of gender.

By examining specific performances, plays and historical individuals over the course of 225 years, this dissertation traces theorizations of gender during these different time periods, combining a close reading of texts with historical research and historiography to offer transgender readings of characters, performers and historical individuals. This project challenges the gender normative assumptions in the theatre scholarship, that previously read these masculine performances through a narrow lens, without fully considering gender identity. The wide temporal range examined in this dissertation allows for the development of a genealogy of genderfluid and transgender performance.",OCLC:1107050963,The Clothes Make the Man Theatrical Crossdressing as Expression of Gender Fluidity in Seventeenth- Through Nineteenth-Century Performance
646,Beyond the Beheading Game,Gender Fluidity and Its Functions in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,Maddison Binkley,"The ideology established by Sir Gawain's literary past depicts the knight as the ""unblemished paragon of chivalric virtue"". This image bleeds into the first fitt of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, stealthily establishing the plot as Gawain's participation in the beheading game in order to meet his obligations to the Green Knight and King Arthur. However, I find that there are complexities to the storyline that reveal it as not being simply dictated by masculine identity and the homosocial, but by a fluid existence of all things masculine and feminine. I propose that this fluidity disrupts the superficial appearance that Gawain's trek to the Green Knight is merely a path to the completion of the beheading game, but instead creates a complicated journey that reveals the world of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight operating under the holistic blend of all gender roles. This proposed fluidity, in turn, questions the conventional binary gender system of the late Middle Ages and informs both the reader and Sir Gawain that the agendas of the masculine and feminine do not exist separately, but together. The existence of fluidity is revealed through analyses of Gawain's liminality, the functions of Hautdesert and Camelot, Gawain's interactions with Lord and Lady Bertilak, as well as his interactions with the pentangle and the green girdle. These analyses signify the shift in Gawain's chivalric values and propel the reader to see the influence of differing genders that exist in the poem. Arguing gender fluidity as the basis under which the world of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight functions results in an interpretation that enriches the current conversation surrounding gender ambiguity in medieval literature.",OCLC:1137727866,Beyond the Beheading Game Gender Fluidity and Its Functions in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
647,Gender Essentialism and Gender Fluidity in Fantasy: A Case Study of C.S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia and J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,,Eva Verhofstede,"Gender is a social construct and an act of performance, as is put forward by feminists Simone de Beauvoir and Judith Butler. It is the consequence of its own representation, both in peoples personal lives and in popular culture. In a patriarchal society, gender is often represented as a binary, in which femininity is disparaged and masculinity is exalted. This division is created by a predominant belief in gender essentialism, which refers to the idea that men and women are in their essence different to each other. Essentialist thinking about gender also perpetuates stereotypes, that harm women in particular, but also men who do not fit into the ideal of hegemonic masculinity, as expounded by R.W. Connell. Especially inaccurate gender representation in popular culture can damage peoples sense of identity by mirroring an inaccurate and often demeaning image of themselves back to them. For this reason, accurate and diverse representation is important. Fiction influences reality just as much as reality influences fiction, so fictional portrayals of the various gender identities influence peoples ideas of gender in reality. Unfortunately, in fantasy fiction especially, there has been a lack of diversity and accuracy. Yet, some progress is being made as well, with authors like Ursula K. Le Guin and Catherynne M. Valente. Still, defenders of so-called traditional fantasy are hindering true change. These people feel fantasy should remain in the tradition of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Traditional fantasy often includes male characters who exhibit idealised masculinity: the hero is powerful, manly and warrior-like, whereas the typical female character is passive, a beautiful statue on a pedestal. A non-binary representation of gender is not offered in these stories or, if a genderqueer character is included, they are ridiculed. This analysis of The Chronicles of Narnia, written by Lewis, and The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, written by Tolkien, looks at whether these texts, which are considered as prototypes for all subsequent traditional fantasy, do actually portray gender in this way. In this reading, the focus will be on whether Lewis and Tolkien are essentialising gender, or whether they also undermine the gender binary by portraying gender-fluid characters, the ones which are often omitted from traditional fantasy (or ridiculed).",OCLC:1050023224,

Drawing on theories from theatre, dance, and performance studies, gender studies, critical race studies, media studies, and Asian studies, I offer close readings of dancers' bodies, movements, and choreographies as well as audiovisual contents in select K-pop music videos. I also analyze audience reception from media coverage to global fans' online comments around the world to see both local and global implications of K-pop. In their videos, K-pop performers move between enacting and negating whiteness, blackness, Asianness, and Koreanness with their fluid gender representations. I argue that these complex, intersectional, and often contradictory stagings, which I call K-popscape, are unreadable in the West due to the pervasiveness (and limitations) of stereotypes about Asian Americans.",OCLC:923846113,K-popscape Gender Fluidity and Racial Hybridity in Transnational Korean Pop Dance

657,Gender Fluidity,"An Alternative Image of Women (and Men), and a Critique of the Colonialist Legacy",Jin Tang (master of music.),"Chinese feudal women have long been identified as victims of the Chinese Confucian patriarchy and discussed in terms of notions of backwardness, dependency, female passivity, biological inferiority, intellectual inability, and social absence. This image of the victimized women, however, is a product of China's modernization and Westernization processes since late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century. Its formation is inseparable from the appropriation of the colonialist categories of sex binarism by the May Fourth male ""new intellectuals."" This binary, linear gender ideology, together with the social context of Confucianism's long-term status as the official, orthodox ideology in premodern China, easily led to the conceptualization of women in terms of absence, marginalization, and ultimately victimization. In this process, Chinese women became Woman, the other of Man, which constitutes a monolithic, ahistorical entity that masks specificities and variations in different historical periods and concrete cultural contexts, and obscures the dynamics of gender relationships. Kunqu (Kun opera) and the literati culture of late Ming (1573-1644) and early Qing Dynasty (1644~1722) surrounding it could be of particular use to demonstrate the problem of this binary and static conceptualization of gender in premodern China. In this study, I will be examining the case of two distinguished kunqu, Mudan ting (The Peony Pavilion) and Taohua shan (The Peach Blossom Fan), whose text, music, and performance raise interesting questions about femininity and masculinity in the specific social and cultural context of the time. Through this study, I want to help illuminate the inadequacy of the modernist, rigid sex binarism in understanding traditional Chinese gender ideology which cannot be reduced to the Western sexual physiology and biology, and to refute the ahistorical construction of the victimized Chinese Woman.",OCLC:778382337,"Gender Fluidity An Alternative Image of Women (and Men), and a Critique of the Colonialist Legacy"

Gender Reckonings aims to map new directions for understanding gender and sexuality within a more pragmatic, dynamic, and socially relevant framework. It shows how gender relations must be understood on a large scale as well as in intimate detail. The contributors return to the basics, questioning how gender patterns change, how we can realize gender equality, and how the structures of gender impact daily life. Gender Reckonings covers not only foundational concepts of gender relations and gender justice, but also explores postcolonial patterns of gender, intersectionality, gender fluidity, transgender practices, neoliberalism, and queer theory. Gender Reckonings combines the insights of gender and sexuality scholars from different generations, fields, and world regions.

665,Questions of Gender in Byzantine Society,,Lynda Garland,"Gender was a key social indicator in Byzantine society, as in many others. While studies of gender in the western medieval period have appeared regularly in the past decade, similar studies of Byzantium have lagged behind. Masculine and feminine roles were not always as clearly defined as in the West, while eunuchs made up a 'third gender' in the imperial court. Social status indicators were also in a state of flux, as much linked to patronage networks as to wealth, as the Empire came under a series of external and internal pressures. This fluidity applied equally in ecclesiastical and secular spheres. The present collection of essays uncovers gender roles in the imperial family, in monastic institutions of both genders, in the Orthodox church, and in the nascent cult of Mary in the east. It puts the spotlight on flashpoints over a millennium of Byzantine rule, from Constantine the Great to Irene and the Palaiologoi, and covers a wide geographical range, from Byzantine Italy to Syria. The introduction frames the following nine chapters against recent scholarship and considers methodological issues in the study of gender and Byzantine society. Together these essays portray a surprising range of male and female experience in various Byzantine social institutions - whether religious, military, or imperial -- over the course of more than a millennium. The collection offers a provocative contrast to recent studies based on western medieval scholarship. Common themes that bind the collection into a coherent whole include specifically Byzantine expectations of gender among the social elite; the fluidity of social and sexual identities for Byzantine men and women within the church; and the specific challenges that strong individuals posed to the traditional limitations of gender within a hierarchical society dominated by Christian orthodoxy.",9781317072348,
667,Tabernacles of Clay,Sexuality and Gender in Modern Mormonism,Taylor G. Petrey,"Taylor G. Petrey's trenchant history takes a landmark step forward in documenting and theorizing about Latter-day Saints (LDS) teachings on gender, sexual difference, and marriage. Drawing on deep archival research, Petrey situates LDS doctrines in gender theory and American religious history since World War II. His challenging conclusion is that Mormonism is conflicted between ontologies of gender essentialism and gender fluidity, illustrating a broader tension in the history of sexuality in modernity itself. As Petrey details, LDS leaders have embraced the idea of fixed identities representing a natural and divine order, but their teachings also acknowledge that sexual difference is persistently contingent and unstable. While queer theorists have built an ethics and politics based on celebrating such sexual fluidity, LDS leaders view it as a source of anxiety and a tool for the shaping of a heterosexual social order. Through public preaching and teaching, the deployment of psychological approaches to ""cure"" homosexuality, and political activism against equal rights for women and same-sex marriage, Mormon leaders hoped to manage sexuality and faith for those who have strayed from heteronormativity.",1469656213,Tabernacles of Clay Sexuality and Gender in Modern Mormonism

Should feminists work to help women specifically or to support all people? Thinking Woman examines the lives and ideas of women in the history of philosophy who wished to understand and advocate for themselves as women. Some, like Hildegard of Bingen and Edith Stein, found women to be a unique creature designed by God, necessary for good stewardship of creation. Others, such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Sojourner Truth, found women to be identical to men in all but biology and thus identical before the law. Still others, from Simone de Beauvoir to Judith Butler, found the very question troubling as they tried to sort out cultural ideas from biological rules. These women and their views form a canon on the question of women, a canon that can help guide the conversation for thinkers and activists today who want both to understand women and to advocate for justice for all people. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",9781625646347,Thinking Woman A Philosophical Approach to the Quandary of Gender

In particular, as the Washington Post reported recently, “the term has been used by social activists as both a rallying cry for more expansive progressive movements and a chastisement for their limitations.” Drawing on black feminist and critical legal theory, Kimberlé Crenshaw developed the concept of intersectionality, a term she coined to speak to the multiple social forces, social identities, and ideological instruments through which power and disadvantage are expressed and legitimized. In this comprehensive and accessible introduction to Crenshaw’s work, readers will find key essays and articles that have defined the concept of intersectionality, collected together for the first time. The book includes a sweeping new introduction by Crenshaw as well as prefaces that contextualize each of the chapters. For anyone interested in movement politics and advocacy, or in racial justice and gender equity, On Intersectionality will be compulsory reading from one of the most brilliant theorists of our time.",9781620972717,On Intersectionality Essential Writings

Calling for a re-centering of difference by exploring the emergence and inception of intersectionality concepts, the coeditors and contributors distinguish between the uses of intersectionality that seem inclusive versus those that actually enact inclusion by demonstrating how to re-conceptualize intersectionality in ways that explicate, elucidate, and elaborate culture-specific and text-specific nuances of knowledge for women of color, queer/trans-people of color, and non-western people of color who have been marked as the Others. As a feminist of color tradition, intersectionality has been appropriated through increasing popularity in the discipline of communication, undermining efforts to critique power when researchers reduce the concept to a checklist of identity markers. This book underscores that in order to play well with and illustrate a nuanced understanding of intersectionality; scholars must be attentive to its origins and implications.",9781498588232,"De-Whitening Intersectionality Race, Intercultural Communication, and Politics"
1064,Intersectionality and Comparative Antidiscrimination Law,The Tale of Two Citadels,Shreya Atrey,"This volume in the Brill Research Perspectives in Comparative Discrimination Law addresses intersectionality from the lens of comparative antidiscrimination law. The term ‘intersectionality’ was coined by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw in 1989. As a field, intersectionality has a longer history, of nearly two hundred years. Meanwhile, comparative antidiscrimination law as a field may be just over a few decades old. Thus, intersectionality’s tryst with antidiscrimination law is a fairly recent one. Developed as a critique of antidiscrimination law, intersectionality has had a significant influence on it. Yet, intersectionality’s logic does not seem to have infiltrated the logic of antidiscrimination law completely. Comparative antidiscrimination law continues to develop with intersectionality in sight, but rarely, in step. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Crenshaw’s seminal article that coined the term in the context of antidiscrimination law, Shreya Atrey explores this irony. Her article provides a meta-narrative of the development of the two fields with the purpose of showing what appear to be orthogonal trajectories.",9789004382862,Intersectionality and Comparative Antidiscrimination Law The Tale of Two Citadels

Bohrer argues that it is only by considering all of the dimensions of race, gender, sexuality, and class within the structures of capitalism and imperialism that we can understand power relations as we find them nowadays. Bohrer explains how many of the purported incompatibilities between Marxism and intersectionality arise more from miscommunication rather than a fundamental conceptual antagonism.

1068,The Palgrave Handbook of Intersectionality in Public Policy,,Olena Hankivsky,"Grounded in black feminist scholarship and activism and formally coined in 1989 by black legal scholar Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, intersectionality has garnered significant attention in the field of public policy and other disciplines/fields of study. The potential of intersectionality, however, has not been fully realized in policy, largely due to the challenges of operationalization. Recently some scholars and activists began to advance conceptual clarity and guidance for intersectionality policy applications; yet a pressing need remains for knowledge development and exchange in relation to empirical work that demonstrates how intersectionality improves public policy. This handbook fills this void by highlighting the key challenges, possibilities and critiques of intersectionality-informed approaches in public policy. It brings together international scholars across a variety of policy sectors and disciplines to consider the state of intersectionality in policy research and analysis. Importantly, it offers a global perspective on the added value and “how-to” of intersectionality-informed policy approaches that aim to advance equity and social justice.",9783319984735,

Intersectionality and Higher Education examines how race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, and other identities connect to produce intersected campus experiences. Contributors look at both the individual and institutional perspectives on issues like campus climate, race, class, and gender disparities, LGBTQ student experiences, undergraduate versus graduate students, faculty and staff from varying socioeconomic backgrounds, students with disabilities, undocumented students, and the intersections of two or more of these topics. Taken together, this volume presents an evidence-backed vision of how the twenty-first century higher education landscape should evolve in order to meaningfully support all participants, reduce marginalization, and reach for equity and equality.",9780813597683,Intersectionality and Higher Education Identity and Inequality on College Campuses

1076,Intersectionality and Urban Education,"Identities, Policies, Spaces & Power",Carl A. Grant,"In urban education, “urban” is a floating signifier that is imbued with meaning, positive or negative by its users. “Urban” can be used to refer to both the geographical context of a city and a sense of “less than,” most often in relation to race and/or socioeconomic status (Watson, 2011). For Noblit and Pink (2007), “Urban, rather, is a generalization as much about geography as it is about the idea that urban centers have problems: problems of too many people, too much poverty, too much crime and violence, and ultimately, too little hope” (p. xv). Recently, urban education scholars such as Anyon (2005), Pink and Noblit (2007), Blanchett, Klinger and Harry (2009), and Lipman (2013) have elucidated the social construction of oppression and privilege for urban students, teachers, schools, families, and communities using intersectionality theories. Building on their work, we see the need for an edited collection that would look across the different realms of urban education—theorizing identity markers in urban education, education in urban schools and communities, thinking intersectionally in teacher education & higher education, educational policies & urban spaces—seeking to better understand each topic using an intersectional lens. Such a collection might serve to conceptually frame or provide methodological tools, or act as a reference point for scholars and educators who are trying to address urban educational issues in light of identities and power. Secondly, we argue that education questions and/or problems beg to be conceptualized and analyzed through more than one identity axis. Policies and practices that do not take into account urban students’ intertwining identity markers risk reproducing patterns of privilege and oppression, perpetuating stereotypes, and failing at the task we care most deeply about: supporting all students’ learning across a holistic range of academic, personal, and justiceoriented outcomes. Can educational policies and practices address the social justice issues faced in urban schools and communities today? We argue that doing intersectional research and implementing educational policies and practices guided by these frameworks can help improve the “fit.” Particular attention needs to be paid to intersectionality as a lens for educational theory, policy, and practice. As urban educators we would be wise to consider the intertwining of these identity axes in order to better analyze educational issues and engage in teaching, learning, research, and policymaking that are bettertuned to the needs of diverse students, families, and communities.",9781623967345,"Intersectionality and Urban Education Identities, Policies, Spaces & Power"
1078,"Pursuing Intersectionality, Unsettling Dominant Imaginaries",,Vivian M. May,"Pursuing Intersectionality, Unsettling Dominant Imaginaries offers a sustained, interdisciplinary exploration of intersectional ideas, histories, and practices that no other text does. Deftly synthesizing much of the existing literatures on intersectionality, one of the most significant theoretical and political precepts of our time, May invites us to confront a disconcerting problem: though intersectionality is widely known, acclaimed, and applied, it is often construed in ways that depoliticize, undercut, or even violate its most basic premises. May cogently demonstrates how intersectionality has been repeatedly resisted, misunderstood, and misapplied: provocatively, she shows the degree to which intersectionality is often undone or undermined by supporters and critics alike. A clarion call to engage intersectionality’s radical ideas, histories, and justice orientations more meaningfully, Pursuing Intersectionality answers the basic questions surrounding intersectionality, attends to its historical roots in Black feminist theory and politics, and offers insights and strategies from across the disciplines for bracketing dominant logics and for orienting toward intersectional dispositions and practices.",9781136497551,

Framing Intersectionality brings together proponents and critics of the concept, to discuss the 'state of the art' with those that have been influential in the debates that surround it. Engaging with the historical roots of intersectionality in the US-based 'race-class-gender' debate, this book also considers the European adoption of this concept in different national contexts, to explore issues such as migration, identity, media coverage of sexual violence against men and transnational livelihoods of high and low skilled migrants. Thematically arranged around the themes of the transatlantic migration of intersectionality, the development of intersectionality as a theory, men's studies and masculinities, and the body and embodiment, this book draws on empirical case studies as well as theoretical deliberations to investigate the capacity and the sustainability of the concept and shed light on the current state of intersectionality research. Presenting the latest work from a team of leading feminist scholars from the US and Europe, Framing Intersectionality will be of interest to all those with interests in gender, women's studies, masculinity, inequalities and feminist thought.",9781317133575,Framing Intersectionality Debates on a Multi-Faceted Concept in Gender Studies

1093,Introducing Intersectionality,,Mary Romero,"How can we hope to understand social inequality without considering race, class, and gender in tandem? How do they interact with other categories such as sexuality, citizenship, and ableism? How does an inclusive analysis of domination and privilege move us closer to solutions touching the lives of diverse populations? In this clearly written book, Mary Romero presents intersectionality as a core facet of the sociological imagination. One-dimensional approaches are no longer acceptable. Instead, we must examine all systems of oppression simultaneously and how they integrate and work with or against each other to shape life experiences. Recognizing the dynamics of patriarchy, capitalism, and white supremacy, Romero shows how social inequality is maintained or minimized in various social settings and everyday sites of interaction. Drawing the theoretical threads together, the book demonstrates intersectional approaches in action in relation to the care crisis and wealth divide, to highlight the different understandings of these issues and their solutions arising from a comprehensive, intersectional examination. Offering an overview of scholarly and activist tradition in the development of intersectionality and how to apply intersectionality as a lens to enrich our understandings of social life, this introductory text will be an invaluable and welcome resource for all students of sociology.",9781509525294,

1097,Byzantine Intersectionality,"Sexuality, Gender, and Race in the Middle Ages",Roland Betancourt,"""Intersectionality, a term coined in 1989, is rapidly increasing in importance within the academy, as well as in broader civic conversations. It describes the study of overlapping or intersecting social identities such as race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, and sexual orientation alongside related systems of oppression, domination, and discrimination. Together, these frameworks are used to understand how systematic injustice or social inequality occurs. In this book, Roland Betancourt examines the presence of marginalized identities and intersectionality in the medieval era. He reveals the fascinating, little-examined conversations in medieval thought and visual culture around matters of sexual and reproductive consent, bullying, non-monogamous marriages, homosocial and homoerotic relationships, trans and non-binary gender identifications, representations of disability, and the oppression of minorities. In contrast to contemporary expectations of the medieval world, this book looks at these problems from the Byzantine Empire and its neighbors in the eastern mediterranean through sources ranging from late antiquity and early Christianity up to the early modern period. In each of five chapters, Betancourt provides short, carefully scaled narratives used to illuminate nuanced and surprising takes on now-familiar subjects by medieval thinkers and artists. For example, Betancourt examines depictions of sexual consent in images of the Virgin; the origins of sexual shaming and bullying in the story of Empress Theodora; early beginnings of trans history as told in the lives of saints who lived portions of their lives within different genders; and the ways in which medieval authors understood and depicted disabilities.

Scholars, educators, policymakers and parents are scrambling to respond to the perceived upsurge in girls’ bullying, peer pressure, and aggression/violence. Girls, Aggression and Intersectionality examines how intersecting social identities – such as race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, age, and others - shape media representations of, and criminal justice reactions to, female aggression. The book focuses on three overarching questions: How do race, class, and/or sexuality influence media images of female aggression? How do aggressive girls’ intersecting identities affect law enforcement and criminal justice responses to their aggression? How are diverse groups of girls trying to resist their labelling and criminalization? Using intersectionality as a conceptual framework, this insightful volume deconstructs a unitary analysis of ""female aggression"" and transforms the mainstream discourse that paints girls as inherently ""mean.""

The theory suggests-and seeks to examine how-various socially and culturally constructed categories such as gender, race, class, disability, and other axes of identity interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels, contributing to systematic social inequality. Intersectionality holds that the classical conceptualizations of oppression within society, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and religion-based bigotry, do not act independently of one another; instead, these forms of oppression interrelate, creating a system of oppression that reflects the ""intersection"" of multiple forms of discrimination.",551281754X,
1107,Undermining Intersectionality,The Perils of Powerblind Feminism,Barbara Tomlinson,"In this provocative book, esteemed scholar Barbara Tomlinson asserts that intersectionality—the idea that categories such as gender, race, and class create overlapping systemsof oppression—is consistently misinterpreted in feminist argument. Despite becoming a central theme in feminist scholarship and activism, Tomlinson believes dominant feminism has failed to fully understand the concept. Undermining Intersectionality reveals that this apparent paradox is the result of the disturbing racial politics underlying more than two decades of widely-cited critiques of intersectionality produced by prominent white feminist scholars who have been insufficiently attentive to racial dynamics. As such, feminist critiques of intersectionality repeatedly reinforce racial hierarchies, undermining academic feminism’s supposed commitment to social justice. Tomlinson offers a persuasive analysis of the rhetorics and conventions of argument used in these critiques to demonstrate their systematic reliance on “powerblind” discursive practices. Undermining Intersectionality concludes by presenting suggestions about concrete steps feminist researchers, readers, authors, and editors can take to promote more productive and principled engagements with intersectional thinking.",1439916519,Undermining Intersectionality The Perils of Powerblind Feminism

Jewish Feminism and Intersectionality explores a range of opportunities to apply and build intersectionality studies from within the life and work of Jewish feminism in the United States today. Marla Brettschneider builds on the best of what has been done in the field and offers a constructive internal critique. Working from a nonidentitarian paradigm, Brettschneider uses a Jewish critical lens to discuss the ways different politically salient identity signifiers cocreate and mutually constitute each other. She also includes analyses of matters of import in queer, critical race, and class-based feminist studies. This book is designed to demonstrate a range of ways that Jewish feminist work can operate with the full breadth of what intersectionality studies has to offer. “Blending feminist political theory with personal narratives, Brettschneider makes a compelling case for the inclusion of Jewish feminist perspectives in intersectionality studies—particularly its potential to provide insight in the undertheorized intersection of race, sexuality, and religious culture.” — Kimala Price, San Diego State University",9781438460352,
1115,Intersectionality in Feminist and Queer Movements,Confronting Privileges,Elizabeth Evans,"Examining the ways in which feminist and queer activists confront privilege through the use of intersectionality, this edited collection presents empirical case studies from around the world to consider how intersectionality has been taken up (or indeed contested) by activists in order to expose and resist privilege. The volume sets out three key ways in which intersectionality operates within feminist and queer movements: it is used as a collective identity, as a strategy for forming coalitions, and as a repertoire for inclusivity. The case studies presented in this book then evaluate the extent to which some, or all, of these types of intersectional activism are used to confront manifestations of privilege. Drawing upon a wide range of cases from across time and space, this volume explores the difficulties with which activists often grapple when it comes to translating the desire for intersectionality into a praxis which confronts privilege. Addressing inter-related and politically relevant questions concerning how we apply and theorise intersectionality in our studies of feminist and queer movements, this timely edited collection will be of interest to students and scholars from across the social sciences and humanities with an interest in gender and feminism, LGBT+ and queer studies, and social movement studies.",9781000747409,Intersectionality in Feminist and Queer Movements Confronting Privileges

The sustained emphasis on activism and practice reasserts the potency of intersectionality borne out of Black feminism. The rare and pioneering international reach of this book crosses four continents. In this book context matters: there is no intersectionality without context! Resting on the premise that we cannot work for the liberation of individuals, communities and societies without intersectionality, this book asks: How does intersectionality challenge the structures and discourses of social work education, management and organisation? What is the revolutionary potential of intersectionality? Intersectional in its method and content, the blend of practice, activism, research and theory troubles geopolitical and disciplinary boundaries. The range of topics include: Islamophobia, immigration, feminist movements, social work education, violence against women and girls, gender, sexuality, race, disability, age, religion, nationality, citizenship policy and legal frameworks. This book will appeal to activists for social justice, social work practitioners, researchers, lecturers, students and those working in the field of Black feminist thinking.

1121,Intersectionality and Criminology,Disrupting and revolutionizing studies of crime,Hillary Potter,"The use of intersectionality theory in the social sciences has proliferated in the past several years, putting forward the argument that the interconnected identities of individuals, and the way these identities are perceived and responded to by others, must be a necessary part of any analysis. Fundamentally, intersectionality claims that not only are people’s lived experiences affected by their racial identity and by their gender identity, but that these identities, and others, continually operate together and affect each other. With ""official"" statistical data that indicate people of Color have higher offending and victimization rates than White people, and with the overrepresentation of men and people of Color in the criminal legal system, new theories are required that address these phenomena and that are devoid of stereotypical or debasing underpinnings. Intersectionality and Criminology provides a comprehensive review of the need for, and use of, intersectionality in the study of crime, criminality, and the criminal legal system.

1123,Intersectionality and Politics,"Recent Research on Gender, Race, and Political Representation in the United States",Carol Hardy-Fanta,"Cutting-edge research on the intersection of race, gender, and politics Traditionally, there has been a significant lack of empirical attention given to the ways in which race/ethnicity, gender, and political representation overlap. Intersectionality and Politics is the groundbreaking collection of contemporary research and essays that applies the concept of intersectionality specifically to descriptive and substantive representation by African-American, Latino/a, and Asian-American elected officials. This unique compilation looks at numerous states and focuses on multiple racial/ethnic groups to demonstrate the importance of this theory for understanding the political leadership of people of color and women. Intersectionality and Politics is the wide-ranging text that is both informative overview and thought-provoking analysis of a subject that has received little practical study. Articles in this important text cover a expansive gamut—from women of color as elected officials and the changing face of leadership in America today to an exploration of the growing interest in intersectionality and a look toward the potential of future research—making it a useful and comprehensive one-stop resource. Contributors to Intersectionality and Politics explore critical topics such as: the contours and context of descriptive representation with a focus on women of color the puzzle of women of color’s proportionately higher percentage of office holding in state legislatures agenda-setting behavior of African-American female state legislators the impact of race and gender on the likelihood of legislative bill submission and passage patterns of gendered representation and related legislative advocacy within Latino delegations in the Southwest new findings on the Latino/a gender gap the public policy implications of intersectionality theory and many more! Complete with extensive bibliographies and a wealth of tables and figures to highlight the striking findings, Intersectionality and Politics is ideal for undergraduate and graduate students and educators in political science, ethnic studies, Latino/Black/Asian studies, gender studies, sociology, and women’s studies. Policymakers, politicians, and those working in high-minority areas will also find this to be an invaluable text.",9781135805470,"Intersectionality and Politics Recent Research on Gender, Race, and Political Representation in the United States"

1134,Me Too Political Science,,Nadia Brown,"Me Too Political Science explores the multiple manifestations and implications of gendered biases in Political Science by ""connecting the dots"" between the sexual harassment described in the recent report on 2017 American Political Science Association’s Survey on Sexual Harassment at Annual Meetings and other problematic issues. Started by Tarana Burke in 2007 to stand with young women of color who survived sexual assault, the MeToo campaign was intended to let women know that they were not alone. In turn, the Women’s Caucus for Political Science used #MeTooPoliSci to bring awareness to sexual harassment, assault and misconduct in the discipline. The essays in this book and the authors’ scholarly activism, harnessed a collective power to dispel the shame, embarrassment and secrecy that surrounds these issues. They focus in particular on bullying, entitled and toxic forms of masculinity; systematic discounting of and dismissiveness and derision toward work on gender and sexuality; biases and inequities associated with hiring, teaching evaluations, service loads, and tenure and promotion; and related and often intersecting forms of harassment but not only those related to race and sexuality. The essays in this volume stem for the 2018 pre-conference held by the Women’s Caucus for Political Science at the American Political Science Association’s annual meeting. Me Too Political Science is of great importance not only to scholars interested in Gender and Women’s Studies, but all those working in the Political Science discipline – and even beyond, to academia as a whole.

After a long, difficult day working with young Black girls who had suffered the unimaginable, Tarana tossed in her bed, unable to sleep as a fit of memories intruded into her thoughts. How could she help these girls if she couldn't even be honest with herself and face her own demons. A fitful night led to pages and pages of scribbled notes with two clear words at the top: ""Me too."" Tarana Burke is the founder and activist behind the largest social movement of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the ""me too"" movement, but first she had to find the strength to say ""me too"" herself. Unbound is the story of how she came to those two words, after a childhood growing up in the Bronx with a loving mother that took a terrible turn when she was sexual assaulted. She became withdrawn and her self split, there was the Tarana that was a good student, model kid, and eager to please young girl, and then there was the Tarana that she hid from everyone else, the one she believed to be bad. The one that would take all the love in her life away if she revealed. Tarana's debut memoir explores how to piece back together our fractured selves. How to not just bring the ""me too"" movement back to empathy, but how to empathize with our past selves, with out ""bad"" selves, and how to begin to love ourselves unabashedly. Healing starts with empowerment, and to Tarana empowerment starts with empathy. This is her story of finding that for herself, and then spreading it to an entire world.

Once a scared little girl, victimized by years of abuse, secrets, and lies that took a toll on her mentally, physically, and spiritually, Leta found a way to leave the darkness and has created a life of freedom, light and happiness. She breaks her healing into three phases: 1) The Victim, 2) The Survivor, and 3) The Advocate. It is only in this final phase that survivors of abuse, and society as a whole, can move from the pulsating anger into protectors and defenders of those in need. Leta found the path of healing, and after years of self-work, she shares her tools to happiness for the victim, for those impacted, and for society.",1942298528,"Love, Me Too Finding a Happy and Fulfilling Life After Sexual Abuse"

What does it mean for women, love and relationships? Is it the only masculinity out there? And, most importantly, how can we get rid of it?

1205,Dissolving Toxic Masculinity,,Thomas Haller,"Our society is riddled with men behaving badly. Sexual harassment, sexual abuse, domestic violence, and misogyny run rampant through politics, Hollywood, professional and amateur sports, college campuses, and our daily work environment. The societal standards dictating that men be strong, unemotional, aggressive, and dominant over women have created toxic masculinity. These social standards have an influence on the development of our sons, and if we leave it up to someone else to teach them about masculinity, we greatly increase the potential for their growing up to be chauvinistic, misogynistic, bigoted men who believe they are none of those things. Voices throughout the country have been shouting the demand for change. Many of these voices call on women to alter their attitudes and behavior, implying that a man's misogynistic behavior is women's fault. Dissolving toxic masculinity cannot and must not come from calling upon girls and women to change. We heed the call for change by raising our boys to be emotionally healthy masculine men, a process that begins at home. Change happens when parents embody and model what they want to see in their children. Our society is riddled with men behaving badly.

1207,Toxic Masculinity,Mapping the Monstrous in Our Heroes,Esther De Dauw,"Contributions by Daniel J. Connell, Esther De Dauw, Craig Haslop, Drew Murphy, Richard Reynolds, Janne Salminen, Karen Sugrue, and James C. Taylor The superhero permeates popular culture from comic books to film and television to internet memes, merchandise, and street art. Toxic Masculinity: Mapping the Monstrous in Our Heroes asks what kind of men these heroes are and if they are worthy of the unbalanced amount of attention. Contributors to the volume investigate how the (super)hero in popular culture conveys messages about heroism and masculinity, considering the social implications of this narrative within a cultural (re)production of dominant, hegemonic values and the possibility of subaltern ideas, norms, and values to be imagined within that (re)production. Divided into three sections, the volume takes an interdisciplinary approach, positioning the impact of hypermasculinity on toxic masculinity and the vilification of “other” identities through such mediums as film, TV, and print comic book literature. The first part, “Understanding Super Men,” analyzes hegemonic masculinity and the spectrum of hypermasculinity through comics, television, and film, while the second part, “The Monstrous Other,” focuses on queer identity and femininity in these same mediums. The final section, “Strategies of Resistance,” offers criticism and solutions to the existing lack of diversity through targeted studies on the performance of gender. Ultimately, the volume identifies the ways in which superhero narratives have promulgated and glorified toxic masculinity and offers alternative strategies to consider how characters can resist the hegemonic model and productively demonstrate new masculinities.",9781496828972,Toxic Masculinity Mapping the Monstrous in Our Heroes

In the wake of the MeToo movement and the upsurge in both feminist and men’s rights activism, traditional masculinity has become the topic of impassioned debate. Is Masculinity Toxic? interrogates the myths surrounding modern manhood, asking whether—and how—we need to change our attitudes toward masculinity in the twenty-first century. Therapist Andrew Smiler addresses the topic of masculinity in four chapters: “Evolving Understandings of Masculinity,” which examines the history of ideas about masculinity, “Male Power to Harm,” which dissects the societal impacts of “toxic” masculinity, including bullying behavior, rape culture, and early male mortality; “Men and Interpersonal Relationships,” discusses how men are encouraged not to express their feelings, the sexual objectification of women, and male attitudes toward fatherhood; and “Changing Face of Masculinity Today,” which details the ways in which masculinity might adapt to the last century’s sweeping changes in gender roles. Is Masculinity Toxic? revisits all sides of the debate, recognizing the positive impact of some of today’s models of masculinity while acknowledging the failures and limitations of others.",9780500774779,
1211,For the Love of Men,From Toxic to a More Mindful Masculinity,Liz Plank,"A nonfiction investigation into masculinity, For The Love of Men provides actionable steps for how to be a man in the modern world, while also exploring how being a man in the world has evolved. In 2019, traditional masculinity is both rewarded and sanctioned. Men grow up being told that boys don’t cry and dolls are for girls (a newer phenomenon than you might realize—gendered toys came back in vogue as recently as the 80s). They learn they must hide their feelings and anxieties, that their masculinity must constantly be proven. They must be the breadwinners, they must be the romantic pursuers. This hasn’t been good for the culture at large: 99% of school shooters are male; men in fraternities are 300% (!) more likely to commit rape; a woman serving in uniform has a higher likelihood of being assaulted by a fellow soldier than to be killed by enemy fire. In For the Love of Men, Liz offers a smart, insightful, and deeply-researched guide for what we're all going to do about toxic masculinity. For both women looking to guide the men in their lives and men who want to do better and just don’t know how, For the Love of Men will lead the conversation on men's issues in a society where so much is changing, but gender roles have remained strangely stagnant. What are we going to do about men? Liz Plank has the answer. And it has the possibility to change the world for men and women alike.",9781250196255,For the Love of Men From Toxic to a More Mindful Masculinity
1213,Toxic Masculinity,,Barbara Krasner,"Since the emergence of the #MeToo movement, the term toxic masculinity has been used as an insult, a defense, and a lazy explanation of society's ills. What is toxic masculinity? Is it inherently a condemnation or is it a nuanced labeling of the limitations of gender roles? Written by diverse authors from a variety of perspectives, the essays in this enlightening resource explore the state of masculinity today, whether toxic masculinity actually exists, how it affects others, and how changes in men's and women's roles may or may not be something to fear.",1534505059,
1215,Toxic Geek Masculinity in Media,"Sexism, Trolling, and Identity Policing",Anastasia Salter,"This book examines changing representations of masculinity in geek media, during a time of transition in which “geek” has not only gone mainstream but also become a more contested space than ever, with continual clashes such as Gamergate, the Rabid and Sad Puppies’ attacks on the Hugo Awards, and battles at conventions over “fake geek girls.” Anastasia Salter and Bridget Blodgett critique both gendered depictions of geeks, including shows like Chuck and The Big Bang Theory, and aspirational geek heroes, ranging from the Winchester brothers of Supernatural to BBC’s Sherlock and the varied superheroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Through this analysis, the authors argue that toxic masculinity is deeply embedded in geek culture, and that the identity of geek as victimized other must be redefined before geek culture and media can ever become an inclusive space.",9783319660776,"Toxic Geek Masculinity in Media Sexism, Trolling, and Identity Policing"
1217,Boys Will Be Boys,"Power, Patriarchy and Toxic Masculinity",Clementine Ford,"The incendiary new book about toxic masculinity and misogyny from Clementine Ford, author of the best-selling feminist manifesto, Fight Like A Girl. Fearless feminist heroine Clementine Ford’s incendiary first book, Fight Like A Girl, is taking the world by storm, galvanising women to demand and fight for real equality and not merely the illusion of it. Now Boys Will Be Boys examines what needs to change for that equality to become a reality. It answers the question most asked of Clementine: 'How do I raise my son to respect women and give them equal space in the world? How do I make sure he's a supporter and not a perpetrator?' Ford demolishes the age-old assumption that superiority and aggression are natural realms for boys, and demonstrates how toxic masculinity creates a disturbingly limited and potentially dangerous idea of what it is to be a man. Crucially, Boys Will Be Boys reveals how the patriarchy we live in is as harmful to boys and men as it is to women and girls, and asks what we have to do to reverse that damage. The world needs to change and this book shows the way.",1786077620,"Boys Will Be Boys Power, Patriarchy and Toxic Masculinity"

1225,After #MeToo,"Feminism, Patriarchy, Toxic Masculinity and Sundry Cultural Delights",Gerard Casey,"In After #MeToo, Gerard Casey provides a critical assessment of the #MeToo movement, situating it in the context of the radical feminism of which it is just the latest manifestation. Apart from its legitimating an indiscriminate attack on men and masculinity, Casey argues that the #MeToo movement has exposed a conceptual fault-line in radical feminist anthropology. Are women fully-developed moral agents, able to exercise moral choice and to take responsibility for what they do; or are women elements of a collective made up of the victims of sexual crimes, whose suffering is not just that of any one individual woman but of the group as a whole? Casey's analysis of the #MeToo movement is prefaced by a brief typology of forms of feminism and by an account of the supposedly universal oppression of women by a malign patriarchy. He argues that if there is such a thing as the patriarchy, it is singularly and spectacularly ineffectual in its operation inasmuch as women, on the whole, are not only not oppressed in comparison to men but are rather the beneficiaries of legal and social privileges. After #MeToo concludes with a consideration of the changing legal definitions of rape. Once understood to be essentially a crime of violence, rape has now come to be regarded as a violation of personal autonomy. In common law systems, a certain conception of consent is now central to the definition of rape, a conception that, Casey argues, is unworkable, at once infantilising women and, at the same time, potentially criminalising every sexual encounter in which a man is involved.",9781788360333,"After #MeToo Feminism, Patriarchy, Toxic Masculinity and Sundry Cultural Delights"
1227,The Man They Wanted Me to Be,Toxic Masculinity and a Crisis of Our Own Making,Jared Yates Sexton,"Based on the provocative and popular New York Times op–ed, this memoir alternates between the examination of a working–class upbringing and a cultural analysis of the historical, psychological, and sociological sources that make up the roots of toxic masculinity and its impact on society. As progressivism changes American society, and globalism shifts labor away from traditional manufacturing, the roles that have been prescribed to men since the Industrial Revolution have been rendered obsolete. Donald Trump's campaign successfully leveraged male resentment and entitlement, and now, with Trump as president and the rise of the #MeToo movement, it’s clear that our current definitions of masculinity are outdated and even dangerous. Deeply personal and thoroughly researched, the author of The People Are Going to Rise Like the Waters Upon Your Shore has turned his keen eye to our current crisis of masculinity using his upbringing in rural Indiana to examine the personal and societal dangers of the patriarchy. The Man They Wanted Me to Be examines how we teach boys what’s expected of men in America, and the long–term effects of that socialization―which include depression, shorter lives, misogyny, and suicide. Sexton turns his keen eye to the establishment of the racist patriarchal structure which has favored white men, and investigates the personal and societal dangers of such outdated definitions of manhood. ""By carefully and soberly examining his own story, Sexton deconstructs American life and gives many examples of how pervasive toxic masculinity is in our culture."" ―Henry Rollins, Los Angeles Times ""This book is critically important to our historical moment . . . Crackles with intensity and absolutely refuses to allow the reader to look away for even a moment from the blight that toxic masculinity in America has wrought."" ―Nicholas Cannariato, NPR",9781640091825,The Man They Wanted Me to Be Toxic Masculinity and a Crisis of Our Own Making

The focus is on misogyny, toxic masculinity, and heteronormativity. The authors of the chapters consider these three concepts in a wide range of popular music styles and genres; they analyse and evaluate how the concepts are maintained and normalized, challenged, and rejected. The interconnected nature of these concepts is also woven throughout the book. The book also seeks to expand the idea of popular music as understood by many in the West to include popular music genres from outside western Europe and North America that are often ignored (for example, Bollywood and Italian hip hop), and to bring in music genres that are inarguably popular, but also sit under other labels such as rap, metal, and punk.",9783030651893,

It outlines these detrimental traits as racism, homophobia, and sexism, and offers gender constancy, gender schema theory, gender stereotype theory, and social determinism as a way of explaining why these traits persist in 21st century masculinity. It also summarizes and discusses three studies of masculinity in popular culture, before emphasizing the importance of researching children’s media more thoroughly. The researcher then conducts a content analysis on twenty-one, randomly selected films with release dates ranging from 1970 to 2016, limiting the sample by decade and film success. The researcher found that there was no significant difference in the number of toxic masculine behaviors performed between the main male unsympathetic character and main male sympathetic character. Finally, the researcher discusses limitations, implications, and future research that can be done to further the study of toxic masculinity in children’s media.",OCLC:1127912251,Toxic Masculinity in Children's Animated Films The Importance of Portrayal
1234,"The Depiction of Gender and Toxic Masculinity in Mark Ravenhill's ""The Cut""",,Kristina von Kölln,"Seminar paper from the year 2020 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Other, grade: 2,0, Technical University of Braunschweig, language: English, abstract: This paper examines the depiction of gender in Mark Ravenhill's play The Cut. Special emphasis is hereby placed on the aspect of ""toxic masculinity"" - a topic which has not lost its relevance since its first definition in the 1980s. Toxic masculinity and patriarchal dystopian systems are closely intertwined and have for some time found their place in feminist dystopian narratives such as The Handsmaid Tale by Margaret Atwood, Octavia Butler's Wild Seed or Vox by Christina Dalcher. At first glance, Marc Ravenhill's The Cut fits into this list only in terms of the dystopian moment. However, upon closer inspection, his play, which focuses almost exclusively on the male characters, also reveals the effects of patriarchal cultures and toxic masculinity on both the female and, in particular, the male members of society. Nevertheless, the aspect of gender and especially toxic masculinity has not yet been dealt with in the context of Ravenhill's work. Merle Tönnies, for example, concentrated primarily on the aspect of the immobility of power in her detailed analysis of The Cut, while Robert Kielawski placed his focus on ""the reinvention of utopia revolution and the big Other in decline"" (Kielawski) - the aspect of gender inequality, however, did not seem to play a role for either of them. Furthermore, neither the critics, nor Ravenhill himself addressed the topic. In order to fill this gap, the present work will analyse The Cut based on the thesis that Marc Ravenhill's The Cut represents a patriarchal dystopia whose members suffer from the effects of toxic masculinity. In the course of this paper Marc Ravenhill and The Cut will be briefly introduced, followed by a theoretical background on gender in dystopian fiction in general and toxic masculinity in particular, and finally the depiction of gender and toxic masculinity in The Cut. In order to be able to undertake an analysis that is as detailed as possible, despite the limited scope of this work, Chapter 4 will focus primarily on the main character of the play, Paul, in order to highlight the aspects of toxic masculinity. However, this should not lead to the assumption that not all other characters would also show similar symptoms.",9783346287939,

Too often conversation about violence in and beyond the Blackfeet focuses on men as perpetrators while ignoring the complexity of how gender intersects with violence. This dissertation scrutinizes the entangled roles of gendering and settler colonialism in how they influence the epidemic of violence by and against Indigenous men. Through Blackfeet life histories and stories, I identify and examine how some men navigate colonial gendering and violence to create better worlds for themselves and their families. While the life histories and stories used here contain elements of pain, my focus centers pushing beyond a ""Vizenor-esque"" survivance to an understanding of thrivance and what it entails, including the need for creating communities of support, personal growth, and healing. This comprehensive examination of Blackfeet masculinity contributes to gender studies, feminist studies, and settler colonial studies; but most importantly it offers the hope of understanding through reinforcing some positive Blackfeet masculinity models to encourage a more balanced and harmonious community.",OCLC:1128289989,

1333,The Inclusion Breakthrough,Unleashing the Real Power of Diversity,Frederick A. Miller,"Constant, continuing, and cataclysmic change is causing a major crisis within business organizations today. Faced with constantly advancing technology, unpredictable market shifts, intense global competition, and an increasingly independent ''free agent'' workforce, the only way for an organization to adapt and succeed is to build a ''culture of inclusion'' that nurtures and draws on the talents of a diverse workforce. Easy to say but hard to do; most organizations are mired in industrial revolution, static-world business models administered by monocultural, bordering-on-oppressive, ''command and control'' hierarchies. Organizations at risk include Fortune 500 giants, entrepreneurial start-ups, manufacturing and retail operations, government agencies, not-for-profits, educational institutions, and others. Most organizational change efforts-whether labeled as diversity efforts, re-engineering, right-sizing, or total-quality-management-are a waste of time, money, and human effort. Most produce more cynicism than results, and they can poison the waters for future change efforts. The Inclusion Breakthrough cuts a path through this potential minefield, offering a proven methodology for strategic organizational change, including models for diagnosing, planning, and implementing inclusion-focused, culture-change strategies tailored to each organization's individual needs. It also describes the key competencies for leading and sustaining a culture of inclusion. Offering real-world results of ''before and after'' surveys, including anecdotal and statistical reports of organizational change achieved using the methodologies described, The Inclusion Breakthrough presents an overview of current workplace conditions, attitudes, and policies based on interviews, surveys, and focus groups encompassing thousands of people in major organizations. The Inclusion Breakthrough demonstrates why the bottom line must be the central focus of any change strategy-and more importantly, how to carry that strategy out successfully.",9781458777546,The Inclusion Breakthrough Unleashing the Real Power of Diversity

1345,Inclusion,The Politics of Difference in Medical Research,Steven Epstein,"As a society, we have learned to value diversity. But can some strategies to achieve diversity mask deeper problems, ones that might require a different approach and different solutions? With Inclusion, Steven Epstein argues that in the field of medical research, the answer is an emphatic yes. Formal concern with diversity in American medical research, Epstein shows, is a fairly recent phenomenon. Until the mid-1980s, few paid close attention to who was included in research subject pools. Not uncommonly, scientists studied groups of mostly white, middle-aged men—and assumed that conclusions drawn from studying them would apply to the rest of the population. But struggles involving advocacy groups, experts, and Congress led to reforms that forced researchers and pharmaceutical companies to diversify the population from which they drew for clinical research. That change has gone hand in hand with bold assertions that group differences in society are encoded in our biology—for example, that there are important biological differences in the ways that people of different races and sexes respond to drugs and other treatments. While the prominence of these inclusive practices has offered hope to traditionally underserved groups, Epstein argues forcefully that it has drawn attention away from the tremendous inequalities in health that are rooted not in biology but in society. There is, for instance, a direct relationship between social class and health status—and Epstein believes that a focus on bodily differences can obscure the importance of this factor. Only when connected to a broad-based effort to address health disparities, Epstein explains, can a medical policy of inclusion achieve its intended effects.",9780226213101,Inclusion The Politics of Difference in Medical Research
1349,Successful Educational Actions for Inclusion and Social Cohesion in Europe,,Ramon Flecha (Ed.),"This monograph analyses and describes successful educational actions with a specific focus on vulnerable groups (i.e. youth, migrants, cultural groups e.g. Roma, women, and people with disabilities). Concrete data that shows success in school performance in subject matters such as math or language will be provided, as well as children, teachers and families accounts of the impact of this success. Alongside, there is an analysis of the relationship between these children’s educational performance with their inclusion or exclusion from different areas of society (i.e. housing, health, employment, and social and political participation). Many studies have already diagnosed and described the causes of educational and social exclusion of these vulnerable groups. This monograph, however, provides solutions, that is, actions for success identified through the INCLUD-ED project, thus providing both, contrasted data and solid theoretical background and development. Some examples of these actions are interactive groups (or heterogeneous grouping in the classroom with reorganisation of human resources), extension of the learning time, homework clubs, tutored libraries, family and community educative participation, family education, or dialogic literary gatherings. All these actions have been defined as successful educational actions, which mean that they lead to both efficiency and equity.

1437,Antiracism Inc.,Why the Way We Talk About Racial Justice Matters,Felice Blake,"Antiracism Inc. traces the ways people along the political spectrum appropriate, incorporate, and neutralize antiracist discourses to perpetuate injustice. It also examines the ways organizers continue to struggle for racial justice in the context of such appropriations. Antiracism Inc. reveals how antiracist claims can be used to propagate racism, and what we can do about it. While related to colorblind, multicultural, and diversity discourses, the appropriation of antiracist rhetoric as a strategy for advancing neoliberal and neoconservative agendas is a unique phenomenon that requires careful interrogation and analysis. Those who co-opt antiracist language and practice do not necessarily deny racial difference, biases, or inequalities. Instead, by performing themselves conservatively as non-racists or liberally as 'authentic' antiracists, they purport to be aligned with racial justice even while advancing the logics and practices of systemic racism. Antiracism Inc. therefore considers new ways of struggling toward racial justice in a world that constantly steals and misuses radical ideas and practices. The critical essays and poetry collected here focus on people and methods that do not seek inclusion in the hierarchical order of gendered racial capitalism. Rather, they focus on aggrieved peoples who have always had to negotiate state violence and cultural erasure, but who also work to build the worlds they envision. These collectivities seek to transform social structures and establish a new social warrant guided by what W.E.B. Du Bois called ""abolition democracy,"" a way of being and thinking that privileges people, mutual interdependence, and ecological harmony over individualist self-aggrandizement and profits. Further, these aggrieved collectivities reshape social relations away from the violence and alienation inherent to gendered racial capitalism, and towards the well-being of the commons. Antiracism Inc. articulates methodologies that strive toward freedom dreams without imposing monolithic or authoritative definitions of resistance. Because power seeks to neutralize revolutionary action through incorporation as much as through elimination, these freedom dreams, as well as the language used to articulate them, are constantly transformed through the critical and creative interventions stemming from the active engagement in liberation struggles. In addition to critical essays by Felice Blake (""How Does Black Cultural Criticism 'Work' in the Age of Antiracist Incorporation?""), Kevin Fellezs (""Nahenahe [Soft, Sweet, Melodious], the Sound of Kanaka Maoli [Native Hawaiian] Refusal""), Daniel Martinez HoSang (""A Wider Type of Freedom""), Paula Ioanide (""Defensive Appropriations""), George Lipsitz (""The Logic of 'Illogical' Opposition: Tools and Tactics for Tough Times""), Alison Reed (""Gentrifying Disciplines: The Institutional Management of Trauma and Creative Dissent""), Phia S.

1442,Antiracism Education In and Out of Schools,,Aminkeng A. Alemanji,"This book explores how antiracism theories can be translated into practice within formal education, as well as in other educational programs outside schools, as very often racism occurs outside the school environment. Combating racism both in and out of school therefore increases the chances of overcoming issues of racism. As racism continues to plague the world, efforts to combat it deserve more attention and diversification across all walks of life. In education, such efforts benefit from being modeled within the framework of antiracism education, rather than simpler multicultural and intercultural theorization and understanding which have proved popular. As such, this book critiques integration and multicultural programs, and instead highlights the advantages of grounding such programs within an antiracist framework. This book demonstrates why and how antiracism education is key to challenging issues of racial injustice at a time when multiculturalism and interculturalism have being proclaimed “dead”. It will be highly relevant to researchers and students working in the areas of Education and Sociology, particularly those with an interest in antiracism methodologies.",9783319563152,
1444,Antiracism,An Introduction,Alex Zamalin,"An introduction to antiracism, a powerful tradition crucial for energizing American democracy On August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, a rally of white nationalists and white supremacists culminated in the death of a woman murdered in the street. Those events made clear that racism is alive and well in the United States of America. However, they also brought into sharp relief another American tradition: antiracism. While racists marched and chanted in the streets, they were met and matched by even larger numbers of protesters calling for racism’s end. Racism is America’s original and most enduring sin, with well-known historic and contemporary markers: slavery, lynching, Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, police brutality. But racism has always been challenged by an opposing political theory and practice. Alex Zamalin’s Antiracism tells the story of that opposition. The most theoretically generative and politically valuable source of antiracist thought has been the black American intellectual tradition. While other forms of racial oppression—for example, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Latino racism—have been and continue to be present in American life, antiblack racism has always been the primary focus of American antiracist movements. From antislavery abolition to the antilynching movement, black socialism to feminism, the long Civil Rights movement to the contemporary Movement for Black Lives, Antiracism examines the way the black antiracist tradition has thought about domination, exclusion, and power, as well as freedom, equality, justice, struggle, and political hope in dark times. Antiracism is an accessible introduction to the political theory of black American antiracism, through a study of the major figures, texts, and political movements across US history. Zamalin argues that antiracism is a powerful tradition that is crucial for energizing American democracy.",9781479822638,Antiracism An Introduction

1448,Antiracism in Cuba,The Unfinished Revolution,Devyn Spence Benson,"Analyzing the ideology and rhetoric around race in Cuba and south Florida during the early years of the Cuban revolution, Devyn Spence Benson argues that ideas, stereotypes, and discriminatory practices relating to racial difference persisted despite major efforts by the Cuban state to generate social equality. Drawing on Cuban and U.S. archival materials and face-to-face interviews, Benson examines 1960s government programs and campaigns against discrimination, showing how such programs frequently negated their efforts by reproducing racist images and idioms in revolutionary propaganda, cartoons, and school materials. Building on nineteenth-century discourses that imagined Cuba as a raceless space, revolutionary leaders embraced a narrow definition of blackness, often seeming to suggest that Afro-Cubans had to discard their blackness to join the revolution. This was and remains a false dichotomy for many Cubans of color, Benson demonstrates. While some Afro-Cubans agreed with the revolution's sentiments about racial transcendence--""not blacks, not whites, only Cubans--others found ways to use state rhetoric to demand additional reforms. Still others, finding a revolution that disavowed blackness unsettling and paternalistic, fought to insert black history and African culture into revolutionary nationalisms. Despite such efforts by Afro-Cubans and radical government-sponsored integration programs, racism has persisted throughout the revolution in subtle but lasting ways.",9781469626734,Antiracism in Cuba The Unfinished Revolution
1450,Crash Politics and Antiracism,Interrogations of Liberal Race Discourse,Philip S. S. Howard,"Crash Politics and Antiracism argues that race and racism continue to script the social fabric in Euro-North America. While dominant discourses claim that we have made significant progress away from racial bigotry, there is no shortage of evidence that inequitable ideologies of race prevail. Similarly, mainstream cinematic productions have mass appeal, yet tend to demonstrate and cement the racial ideologies that circulate in society. As such, they can be used either for the propagation of dominant ideologies or in the development of critical consciousness. Crash Politics and Antiracism does the latter, understanding the award-winning film Crash as an especially interesting pedagogical site, for while to many it offers a fresh analysis of race and racism, the antiracist analyses in this book suggest that it recycles oppressive understandings of race. The essays in this collection, written from a variety of racial locations, provide readings of Crash that seek to disrupt the movie's subtle messages and, more importantly, some of the intractable liberal notions of race that perpetuate racial inequity. The considerations raised in this volume will enrich critical conversations about how race and racism work in contemporary Euro-North American societies - whether these conversations occur in classrooms, boardrooms, or living rooms.",1433102463,Crash Politics and Antiracism Interrogations of Liberal Race Discourse
1452,Race and Antiracism in Black British and British Asian Literature,,Dave Gunning,"Race and Antiracism in Black British and British Asian Literature' offers the first extended exploration of the cultural impact of the politics of race and antiracism in Britain through focussing on a selection of recent novels by black British and British Asian writers. The study argues that an understanding of how race and ethnicity function in contemporary Britain can only be gained through attention to antiracism: the politics of opposing discrimination that manifest at the level of state legislation, within local and national activism, and inside the scholarly exploration of race. It is antiracism that now most strongly conditions the emergence of racial categorisations but also of racial identities and models of behaviour. This sense of how antiracism may determine the form and content of both political debate and individual identity is traced through an examination of ten novels by black British and British Asian writers. These authors range from the well known to the critically neglected: works by Monica Ali, Nadeem Aslam, Fred D'Aguiar, Ferdinand Dennis, Hanif Kureishi, Gautam Malkani, Caryl Phillips, Mike Phillips, Zadie Smith, and Meera Syal are carefully read to explore the impacts of antiracism. These literary studies are grouped into three main themes, each of which is central to the direction of racial political identities over the last two decades in Britain: the use of the continent of Africa as a symbolic focus for black political culture; the changing forms of Muslim culture in Britain; and the emergence of a multiculturalist ethos based around the notion of ethnic communities.",9781781388181,
1454,Discourses of Antiracism in France,,Catherine Lloyd,"First published in 1998, this book is an examination of antiracist discourses and practices in France. It sets out to trace the development of post-war French antiracism through the life of antiracist organizations, setting this within a broader historical, political and social context. It breaks new ground in that it analyses antiracism as a body of ideas in its own right, rather than as a mirror image of racism. The author uses previously unpublished archival material from French organizations combined with observations from current events. She argues that antiracist discourses and practices are structured around four main themes: discrimination, representation, solidarity and hegemony. While perceptions of discrimination have evolved into complex understandings of social exclusion, the representational functions of antiracist groups were challenged by immigrant workers movements themselves. Solidarity remained central to antiracist practices in different political contexts. Underpinning these features lies a hegemonic social project through which antiracists have sought to promote a 'common sense' through political and educational campaigns. The author concludes that French antiracism although constantly changing and refocusing is now a pluralist, transversal, hegemonic movement and an important component of civil society.",9780429829123,
1456,Transpacific Antiracism,"Afro-Asian Solidarity in 20th-Century Black America, Japan, and Okinawa",Yuichiro Onishi,"Transpacific Antiracism introduces the dynamic process out of which social movements in Black America, Japan, and Okinawa formed Afro-Asian solidarities against the practice of white supremacy in the twentieth century. Yuichiro Onishi argues that in the context of forging Afro-Asian solidarities, race emerged as a political category of struggle with a distinct moral quality and vitality. This book explores the work of Black intellectual-activists of the first half of the twentieth century, including Hubert Harrison and W. E. B. Du Bois, that took a pro-Japan stance to articulate the connection between local and global dimensions of antiracism. Turning to two places rarely seen as a part of the Black experience, Japan and Okinawa, the book also presents the accounts of a group of Japanese scholars shaping the Black studies movement in post-surrender Japan and multiracial coalition-building in U.S.-occupied Okinawa during the height of the Vietnam War which brought together local activists, peace activists, and antiracist and antiwar GIs. Together these cases of Afro-Asian solidarity make known political discourses and projects that reworked the concept of race to become a wellspring of aspiration for a new society.",9781479897322,"Transpacific Antiracism Afro-Asian Solidarity in 20th-Century Black America, Japan, and Okinawa"

In exploring these questions David Gillborn makes a vital contribution to the debate on 'race' and racism in education. He focuses on racism in the policy, research, theory and practice of education, and includes the first major study of antiracism at the level of whole-school management and classroom practice. The voices of teachers and school students bring the issues to life, and illustrate the daily problems of life in urban schools. This is a fascinating picture of the key matters facing managers, classroom teachers and their students as schools struggle to develop strong and workable approaches to anti-racist education. It is accompanied by a critical review of current debates and controversies concerning 'race', ethnicity and identity. Arguing for a critical return to the concept of 'race', Racism and Antiracism in Real Schools represents an important addition to the literature on the theory and practice of education in a racist society.",9780335190928,"Racism And Antiracism In Real Schoolsa Theory, Policy, Practice"
1467,Racial Revolutions,Antiracism and Indian Resurgence in Brazil,Jonathan W. Warren,"Since the 1970s there has been a dramatic rise in the Indian population in Brazil as increasing numbers of pardos (individuals of mixed African, European, and indigenous descent) have chosen to identify themselves as Indians. In Racial Revolutions—the first book-length study of racial formation in Brazil that centers on Indianness—Jonathan W. Warren draws on extensive fieldwork and numerous interviews to illuminate the discursive and material forces responsible for this resurgence in the population. The growing number of pardos who claim Indian identity represents a radical shift in the direction of Brazilian racial formation. For centuries, the predominant trend had been for Indians to shed tribal identities in favor of non-Indian ones. Warren argues that many factors—including the reduction of state-sponsored anti-Indian violence, intervention from the Catholic church, and shifts in anthropological thinking about ethnicity—have prompted a reversal of racial aspirations and reimaginings of Indianness. Challenging the current emphasis on blackness in Brazilian antiracist scholarship and activism, Warren demonstrates that Indians in Brazil recognize and oppose racism far more than any other ethnic group. Racial Revolutions fills a number of voids in Latin American scholarship on the politics of race, cultural geography, ethnography, social movements, nation building, and state violence.

While anti-racist struggles during the twentieth century were largely pitched against overt forms of racism (e.g., pogroms, genocide, segregation, apartheid, and 'ethnic cleansing'), it has become increasingly apparent that there are other, less visible, forms of racism. These subtler incarnations are of special interest to the contributors. The intent of Race, Racialization, and Antiracism in Canada and Beyond is to probe systemic forms of racism, as well as to suggest strategies for addressing them. The collection is organized by themes pertinent to political and social expressions of racism in Canada and the wider world, such as the state and its mediation of race, education and the perpetuation of racist marginalization, and the role of the media. The contributors argue that, in order to effectively combat racism, various methodological approaches are required, approaches that are reflective of the diversity of the world we seek to understand.",9781442690783,
1471,Integrative Antiracism,South Asians in Canadian Academe,Edith P. Samuel,"From both a theoretical and practical standpoint, racism is one of the most important topics that has engaged the attention of social scientists in North America in recent years. As societies become more ethnically diverse, people from different cultures are increasingly coming into contact with each other, resulting in ever greater opportunities for racism to manifest itself. In this work, Edith Samuel examines the educational experiences of South Asian students and faculty members from the perspective of 'integrative antiracism' - the study of how the dynamics of social difference are mediated in people's daily lives. Specifically, she analyses perceptions of and responses to racism in four critical areas: faculty-student relationships, peer group interactions, curriculum, and the psychosocial dimension. Antiracism scholars maintain that racism is widespread on Canadian university campuses. Drawing on the available literature and extensive interviews with students and faculty, Samuel looks at both overt and covert forms of racism, as well as structural racism, that results in discrimination in admissions and employment. She also looks at race, class, gender, history, and culture and how these interlocking systems produce unique experiences of racism for South Asians in academe. Through the exploration of the intricate patterns of South Asians' assimilation into university life, Integrative Antiracism identifies the numerous barriers racial minorities encounter and suggests a variety of approaches to fostering a more equitable education system.",9780802037824,Integrative Antiracism South Asians in Canadian Academe

1477,Antiracism and Antiracist Discourse in France from 1900 to the Present Day,,James Robert House,"The thesis examines examples of antiracism and antiracist discourse in France, using an approach which combines history, sociology, discourse analysis and political science. It is based on archive source material and the publications of antiracist, antifascist and anticolonial movements in the period since 1900. Previous examples of research on antiracism in France have often limited their analysis to very contemporary forms of antiracism, and have given a definition of antiracism which I term 'republican antiracism'. Republican antiracism, definable as a form of antiracism closely linked to republican political culture, takes its values from the Revolutionary heritage of 1789, and stresses universal rights and values. Republican antiracism is studied here from the 'founding event' of the Dreyfus ""Affair"", through subsequent reworkings and reformulations in the 1930s (antifascism), 1940s, 1950s and 1980s. The thesis focuses on the complex discourses of nation, assimilation, egalitc and rights articulated within the republican tradition, the left and republican antiracism. A definition of antiracism is given here as emanating from a variety of areas (for example antiracist organizations, immigrant rights associations, trades unions) and levels (cultural, economic etc.) of production. This idea of a multiplicity of sites of production of antiracism is illustrated with a study of the relationship between antiracism and antifascism in the 1930s, and the opposition to anti-Maghrebian racism in the period 1947-1962. Throughout, it is suggested that the terms 'universalism' and 'difference' are insufficient as analytical tools for understanding antiracism as ideology, discourse and practice, just as it is argued diat antiracism is irreducible to being the 'double' of racism. To highlight the broad definition of antiracism used, I look at the lessons to be learned for antiracism from anticolonial forms of opposition to racism in the period 1919-1939, suggesting that these mobilizations provided a radical critique of colonial racism which republican antiracism had failed to develop. I examine how republican antiracism in the post-1945 period then integrated this concept of colonial racism as a category of racism. The historical focus of the thesis is supplemented with a thematic approach to the notion of memory as used within antiracism, notably the memory of colonial and postcolonial forms of racism within the State. The memory of the massacre of Algerians in Paris on 17th October 1961 is studied as an example.",OCLC:817234282,
1480,A Pedagogy of Anticapitalist Antiracism,"Whiteness, Neoliberalism, and Resistance in Education", Zachary A. Casey,"Argues that the economic system itself is culpable in maintaining our oppressive educational status quo. Through an analysis of whiteness, capitalism, and teacher education, A Pedagogy of Anticapitalist Antiracism sheds light on the current conditions of public education in the United States. We have created an environment wherein market-based logics of efficiency, lowering costs, and increasing returns have worked to disadvantage those populations most in need of educational opportunities that work to combat poverty. This book traces the history of whiteness in the United States with an explicit emphasis on the ways in which the economic system of capitalism functions to maintain historical practices that function in racist ways. Practitioners and researchers alike will find important insights into the ways that the history of white racial identity and capitalism in the United States impact our present reality in schools. Casey concludes with a discussion of “revolutionary hope” and possibilities for resistance to the barrage of dehumanizing reforms and privatization engulfing much of the contemporary educational landscape. “This book is groundbreaking.

1491,A Theory of Antiracism,A System of Ideas and Policies that Fight Racial Inequality - Book 3,Melissia Earnest,"""What would you do if someone were to tell you that not being a racist isn't good enough? And that you can actually solve many of society's ills by being an antiracist? Antiracism is a transformative concept that reorients and reenergizes the conversation about racism-and, even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. A Theory of Antiracism will make you a better, kinder, and more fair person by revealing how deeply ingrained racism is in our society and outlining what we can all do to annihilate it completely. Although society has made great strides, racism is still a sickening issue we deal with today. And while we have the obvious horror of cops killing some black people for no reason, this is only one of many problems that racism brings into our society that we all have a duty to fix. This is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond the awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a just and equitable society.",9798738171178,A Theory of Antiracism A System of Ideas and Policies that Fight Racial Inequality - Book 3

It is a self-described ""remix"" of Kendi's 2016 National Book Award winner Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America. An award-winning writer of young adult fiction and poetry, Reynolds frames America's history of racist ideas for an audience of middle school and high school readers. Reynolds' remix is bookended by an introduction written by Kendi and an Afterword that transitions the reader out of the historical narrative and, hopefully, into antiracist action. This study guide refers to the 2020 hardcover edition published by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers.The book establishes several patterns through which to organize and understand historical racism in the United States. The authors divide ""racist"" and ""not racist"" into three categories: ""segregationist"" racism, the commitment to the separation and hierarchy of races; ""assimilationist"" racism, the push to integrate Black people into White society and abandon Blackness; and ""antiracism,"" the school of thought that believes in full racial equality, period.Like Stamped from the Beginning, Stamped is divided into sections that cover distinct historical time periods, each anchored by a central historical figure who is representative of racist or antiracist developments in their lifetimes. Though the first section covers the broadest range of history and geography-African slave trading across the globe from 1415 to 1728-its main emphasis is the establishment of racist systems in the lands that became the United States. The leading racist intellectual of Colonial America was the Puritan minister Cotton Mather. The next segment ruminates on the contradictions in the racial ideology of Thomas Jefferson throughout his political career. In the third section, the authors discuss the antislavery ideology of editor William Lloyd Garrison and the politics of Abraham Lincoln. The fourth section centers on the long intellectual career of W. E. B. Du Bois, who shifted from assimilationism to antiracist activism in the 20th century. The last section focuses on Dr. Angela Davis, the Black feminist who embodies antiracist empowerment and resistance.",9798682499342,"Sumary of Stamped Racism, Antiracism, and You: by Jason Reynolds, Ibram X.

It has more to do with claiming antiracism as an identity than with actually doing antiracism work, although I do not deny that being and doing are intertwined. Focusing on the being, the identity, keeps it personal and helps me concentrate on learnings and experiences I have found helpful as I have joined the struggle for antiracism. In the context of this writing, it saved me from going down the track of describing various antiracism training programs and analyzing them as to which one would make someone capable of doing antiracism.",OCLC:870650348,Crossing a Creek Choosing Antiracism Identity as a White Woman in Unitarian Universalist Parish Ministry

1503,Intersectionality,,Patricia Hill Collins,"The concept of intersectionality has become a hot topic in academic and activist circles alike. But what exactly does it mean, and why has it emerged as such a vital lens through which to explore how social inequalities of race, class, gender, sexuality, age, ability and ethnicity shape one another? In this new book Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge provide a much-needed, introduction to the field of intersectional knowledge and praxis. They analyze the emergence, growth and contours of the concept and show how intersectional frameworks speak to topics as diverse as human rights, neoliberalism, identity politics, immigration, hip hop, global social protest, diversity, digital media, Black feminism in Brazil, violence and World Cup soccer. Accessibly written and drawing on a plethora of lively examples to illustrate its arguments, the book highlights intersectionality's potential for understanding inequality and bringing about social justice oriented change. Intersectionality will be an invaluable resource for anyone grappling with the main ideas, debates and new directions in this field.",9780745684529,

Darüber hinaus bezeugt das ungebrochene Interesse an dieser Debatte, dass es eines kritischen Reflexionsinstrumentes von Ungleichheit und Differenz in Wissenschaft und Politik bedarf. Was also ist das Verhältnis von Intersektionalität und Kritik respektive kann Intersektionalität kritisch sein? Dieser Band behandelt die Frage in dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens wird Intersectionality im Spannungsfeld von wissenschaftlichen und politischen Praktiken analysiert. Zweitens wird Intersectionality als Methodenreflexion, das heißt als Kritik an herkömmlichen Methoden der jeweiligen Disziplinen, präsentiert. Drittens werden Ansätze diskutiert, die Intersectionality als kritisches Instrument für die Reflexion von Geschichte und Gesellschaft fruchtbar machen.",9783531177267,
1513,On Intersectionality,The Essential Writings of Kimberle Crenshaw,Kimberle Crenshaw,"Over the past twenty years, the concept of ?intersectionality” has emerged as an influential approach to understanding the complex facets of discrimination and exclusion in a society whose members?with often complex racial, gender, or sexual identities?can experience bias in multiple ways. In this incisive introduction to Crenshaw's groundbreaking work, readers will find the key essays and articles that have defined the concept of intersectionality collected together for the first time. Crenshaw explores how a holistic analysis of discrimination gives rise to a more nuanced understanding of salient social forces. This long-awaited volume examines the Central Park jogger case, Alice Walker's The Color Purple, LGBT activism, Anita Hill's testimony against Clarence Thomas, and other significant matters of public interest. In each case, her analysis challenges and exposes the intricate social dynamics among individuals and groups whose identities are increasingly layered. This new account covers the evolution of the meaning of intersectionality over the course of two decades and how this concept has radically changed the face of social justice activism.

While ""intersectionality"" tends to circulate merely as a buzzword, Anna Carastathis joins other critical voices in urging a more careful reading. Challenging the narratives of arrival that surround it, Carastathis argues that intersectionality is a horizon, illuminating ways of thinking that have yet to be realized; consequently, calls to ""go beyond"" intersectionality are premature. A provisional interpretation of intersectionality can disorient habits of essentialism, categorical purity, and prototypicality and overcome dynamics of segregation and subordination in political movements. Through a close reading of critical race theorist Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw's germinal texts, published more than twenty-five years ago, Carastathis urges analytic clarity, contextual rigor, and a politicized, historicized understanding of this pervasive concept. Intersectionality's roots in social justice movements and critical intellectual projects--specifically black feminism--must be retraced and synthesized with a decolonial analysis so that its potential to actualize coalitions can be enacted.",1496212487,"Intersectionality Origins, Contestations, Horizons"
1523,Intersectionality and Urban Education,"Identities, Policies, Spaces, and Power",Carl A. Grant,"A volume in Urban Education Studies Series Series Editors Nicholas D. Hartlep, Illinois State University, Thandeka K. Chapman, University of California, San Diego and Kenny Varner, Louisiana State University In urban education, ""urban"" is a floating signifier that is imbued with meaning, positive or negative by its users. ""Urban"" can be used to refer to both the geographical context of a city and a sense of ""less than,"" most often in relation to race and/ or socioeconomic status (Watson, 2011). For Noblit and Pink (2007), ""Urban, rather, is a generalization as much about geography as it is about the idea that urban centers have problems: problems of too many people, too much poverty, too much crime and violence, and ultimately, too little hope"" (p. xv). Recently, urban education scholars such as Anyon (2005), Pink and Noblit (2007), Blanchett, Klinger and Harry (2009), and Lipman (2013) have elucidated the social construction of oppression and privilege for urban students, teachers, schools, families, and communities using intersectionality theories. Building on their work, we see the need for an edited collection that would look across the different realms of urban education-theorizing identity markers in urban education, education in urban schools and communities, thinking intersectionally in teacher education & higher education, educational policies & urban spaces-seeking to better understand each topic using an intersectional lens. Such a collection might serve to conceptually frame or provide methodological tools, or act as a reference point for scholars and educators who are trying to address urban educational issues in light of identities and power. Secondly, we argue that education questions and/or problems beg to be conceptualized and analyzed through more than one identity axis. Policies and practices that do not take into account urban students' intertwining identity markers risk reproducing patterns of privilege and oppression, perpetuating stereotypes, and failing at the task we care most deeply about: supporting all students' learning across a holistic range of academic, personal, and justice-oriented outcomes. Can educational policies and practices address the social justice issues faced in urban schools and communities today? We argue that doing intersectional research and implementing educational policies and practices guided by these frameworks can help improve the ""fit."" Particular attention needs to be paid to intersectionality as a lens for educational theory, policy, and practice. As urban educators we would be wise to consider the intertwining of these identity axes in order to better analyze educational issues and engage in teaching, learning, research, and policymaking that are better-tuned to the needs of diverse students, families, and communities.",1623967325,"Intersectionality and Urban Education Identities, Policies, Spaces, and Power"

1527,Antagonizing White Feminism,Intersectionality’s Critique of Women’s Studies and the Academy,Noelle Chaddock,"Antagonizing White Feminism: Intersectionality’s Critique of Women’s Studies and the Academy pushes back against the exclusive scholarship and discourse coming out of women-centered spaces and projects, which throw up barriers by narrowly defining who can participate. Vehement resistance to using inclusive language and renaming scholarly spaces like Women’s Studies and Critical Feminism expresses itself in concerns that women are still oppressed and thus women-only spaces must be maintained. But who is a woman? What are the characteristics of a woman’s lived experience? Do affinity and a history of oppression justify exclusion? This book shows how intersectional feminism is often underperformed and appropriated as a “woke” vocabulary by elite women who are unwilling to do the necessary emotional work around their privilege. As Trans Women, Femmes, Women of Color, Queer Women, Gender Variant, and Gender Non-Conforming scholars emerge, the heteronormative, cisgender, colonial idea of women and the feminine is rapidly under attack. The contributors believe that to engage in the necessary conversations about the oppressed performing oppression is to disrupt the exclusionary basis of monolithic understandings of the feminine. Only then can we advance the coalition needed to forge a multiracial, multicultural, queer-led, anti-imperialist feminism.",9781498588355,Antagonizing White Feminism Intersectionality’s Critique of Women’s Studies and the Academy
1535,Intersectionality in Educational Research,,James L. Olive,"The purpose of this work is to advance understanding of intersectional theory and its application to research in education. The scholars whose work appear in this volume utilize intersectional theory and research methods to work in fields and disciplines such as Education, Sociology, Women’s Studies, Africana Studies, Human Development, Higher Education Administration, Leadership Studies, and Justice Studies. The book illustrates how intersectional theory can be used in both quantitative and qualitative education research on college student access and success, faculty satisfaction and professional development, and K-12 educational issues such as high school dropouts and bullying. This book is unique, as no other book ties intersectionality to the research process. Key Features: * Readers will learn the basic tenets of intersectionality and how it can be useful in education research. * Readers will learn how intersectionality can be used to analyze both quantitative (large scale survey) and qualitative (interview, participant observation, and ethnographic) data. * Lastly, readers will learn how intersectionality can be particularly useful in examining the experiences of diverse groups of students attending elementary schools, high schools, colleges and universities, and faculty working at post-secondary institutions. Intersectionality is increasingly being used in research and education. This theory holds great promise in exploring students’ experiences in terms of access, success, and outcomes for marginalized groups. In essence, application of the theory promotes critical complex thinking regarding the intersectionality of race, class, and gender and their outcomes.",9781620360989,

The volume hosts a lively conversation about the nature and significance of biblical interpretation in a global context, focusing on issues at the nexus of operations of power, textual ambiguity, and intersectionality. Engaged here are notions of biblical authority and postures of dissent; women's agency, discernment, rivalry, and alliance in ancient and contemporary contexts; ideological constructions of sexuality and power; interpretations related to indigeneity, racial identity, interethnic intimacy, and violence in colonial contexts; theologies of the feminine divine and feminist understandings of the sacred; convictions about interdependence and conditions of flourishing for all beings in creation; and ethics of resistance positioned over against dehumanization in political, theological, and hermeneutical praxes.

This book finds out how migrants from a peri-urban neighbourhood on the outskirts of Cochabamba, Bolivia, make sense of the migration journeys they have undertaken. Migration is intrinsically related to social transformation. Through life stories and community surveys, the author explores how gender, class, and ethnicity intersect in people’s attempts to make the most of the opportunities presented to them in distant labour markets. While aiming to improve their economic and material conditions, migrants have created a new transnational community that has undergone significant changes in the ways in which gender relations are organised. Women went from being mainly housewives to taking on the role of the family’s breadwinner in a matter of just one decade. This book asks and addresses important questions such as: what does this mean for gender equality and women’s empowerment? Can we talk of migration being emancipatory? Does intersectionality shed light in the analysis of everyday social transformations in contexts of transnational migrations? This book will be useful to researchers and students of human geography, development studies and Latin America area studies.",9781317024873,"Gender, Migration and Social Transformation Intersectionality in Bolivian Itinerant Migrations"
1559,Intersectionality in Action,A Guide for Faculty and Campus Leaders for Creating Inclusive Classrooms and Institutions,Peter Felten,"Colleges and universities silo diversity and inclusion by creating specific courses to address them, or programs to welcome and support people with a range of identities, whereas in reality students, faculty and staff do not encounter diversity in the fractured ways that match the organizational structures of our institutions. We all simultaneously embody a variety of identities with different saliency in different circumstances and times. This book offers models for institutions to move intentionally toward intersections – of study abroad and multiculturalism, of race and gender and religion, and of other essential aspects of our educational programs and our students’ identities – to open doors to new possibilities that better prepare our students for life in a diverse world, and that allow our institutions to become more efficient and effective as we strive to not simply do things better in our own separate spheres, but to do better things by working together across difference. Each chapter offers action-oriented analysis focusing on particular campus intersections, rather than attending to specific demographic groups. Chapter authors also build on their own local expertise of doing this work on campuses that often do not have deep pockets or rich histories of such efforts. The book is organized into three sections: People focuses on diversity broadly defined, considering questions about how we recruit and engage the students, faculty, and staff in the campus community, and how we work with governing boards and others to promote inclusive excellence. Environment focuses on inclusion, including residence life, the local community, the working and learning environment, and external factors and events such as national and international news events or town gown relationships. Learning focuses on perspective taking and learning about difference in the core curriculum, the disciplines, and the co-curriculum, as well as professional development for faculty and staff. This ground breaking book aims to help readers, no matter what position they occupy on campus, to develop the knowledge and capacities necessary to do this essential work and is premised on the understanding that identity, oppression, power and marginalization cannot be accomplished by looking solely at single identities.",1620363208,Intersectionality in Action A Guide for Faculty and Campus Leaders for Creating Inclusive Classrooms and Institutions

While intersectionality helps shed light on contemporary social issues, Collins notes that it has yet to reach its full potential as a critical social theory. She contends that for intersectionality to fully realize its power, its practitioners must critically reflect on its assumptions, epistemologies, and methods. She places intersectionality in dialog with several theoretical traditions—from the Frankfurt school to black feminist thought—to sharpen its definition and foreground its singular critical purchase, thereby providing a capacious interrogation into intersectionality's potential to reshape the world.",9781478007098,

This anthology discusses the ways in which clinicians and patients inadvertently reproduce experiences of privilege and marginalization in the consulting room. Focusing particularly on the experiences of immigrants, women of color, sex workers, and LGBTQ individuals, the contributing authors explore how similarities and differences between the patient's and analyst's gender, race, and sexual orientation can be acknowledged, challenged, and negotiated. Combining intersectional theory with relational psychoanalytic thought, the authors introduce a number of thought-provoking clinical vignettes to suggest how adopting an intersectional approach can help us navigate the space between pathology and difference in psychotherapy. By bringing together these new psychoanalytically-informed perspectives on clinical work with minority and marginalized individuals, Intersectionality and Relational Psychoanalysis makes an important contribution to psychoanalysis, psychology, and social work.",9781000028539,"Intersectionality and Relational Psychoanalysis New Perspectives on Race, Gender, and Sexuality"

The question arises from the realisation that people, who are severally and severely disadvantaged because of their race, religion, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, class etc, often find themselves at the margins of human rights; their condition seldom improved and sometimes even worsened by the rights discourse. How does one make sense of this relationship between the complexity of people's disadvantage and violation of their human rights? Does the human rights discourse, based on its universal and common values, have tools, methods or theories to capture and respond to the difference in people's lived experience of rights? Can intersectionality help in that quest? This book seeks to inaugurate this line of inquiry.",9781509935307,

Heterosexual culture simultaneously institutionalizes its narrations and normalcies, operating in a way that preserves its own coherency. Heteronormativity gains its privileges and coherency through public operations and the mutuality of the public and private spheres. The contributors to this edited collection examine this coherency and privilege and explore in ethnographic detail the operations and making of heteronormative devices: material, affective, narrative, spatial, and bodily.

1581,Sexuality and Gender Now,Moving Beyond Heteronormativity,Leezah Hertzmann,"Sexuality and Gender Now uses a psychoanalytic approach to arrive at a more informed view of the experience and relationships of those whose sexuality and gender may not align with the heterosexual ""norm"". This book confronts the heteronormative bias dominant in psychoanalysis, using a combination of theoretical and clinical material, offering an important training tool as well as being relevant for practicing clinicians. The contributors address the shift clinicians must make not only to support their patients in a more informed and non-prejudicial way, but also to recognise their own need for support in developing their clinical thinking. They challenge assumptions, deconstruct theoretical ideas, extend psychoanalytic concepts, and, importantly, show how clinicians can attend to their pre-conscious assumptions. They also explore the issue of erotic transference and countertransference, which, if unaddressed, can limit the possibilities for supporting patients more fully to explore their sexuality and gender. Theories of psychosexuality have tended to become split off from the main field of psychoanalytic thought and practice or read from an assumed moral high ground of heteronormativity. The book specifically addresses this bias and introduces new ways of using psychoanalytic ideas. The contributors advocate a wider and more flexible attitude to sexuality in general, which can illuminate an understanding of all sexualities, including heterosexuality. Sexuality and Gender Now will be essential reading for professionals and students of psychoanalysis who want to broaden their understanding of sexuality and gender in their clinical practice beyond heteronormative assumptions.",9781000022940,Sexuality and Gender Now Moving Beyond Heteronormativity
1583,Heteronormativity in Eighteenth-Century Literature and Culture,,Ana de Freitas Boe,"The resurgence of marriage as a transnational institution, same-sex or otherwise, draws upon as much as it departs from enlightenment ideologies of sex, gender, and sexuality which this collection aims to investigate, interrogate, and conceptualize anew. Coming to terms with heteronormativity is imperative for appreciating the literature and culture of the eighteenth century writ large, as well as the myriad imaginaries of sex and sexuality that the period bequeaths to the present. This collection foregrounds British, European, and, to a lesser extent, transatlantic heteronormativities in order to pose vital if vexing questions about the degree of continuity subsisting between heteronormativities of the past and present, questions compounded by the aura of transhistoricity lying at the heart of heteronormativity as an ideology. Contributors attend to the fissures and failures of heteronormativity even as they stress the resilience of its hegemony: reconfiguring our sense of how gender and sexuality came to be mapped onto space; how public and private spheres were carved up, or gendered and sexual bodies socially sanctioned; and finally how literary traditions, scholarly criticisms, and pedagogical practices have served to buttress or contest the legacy of heteronormativity.",9781317122050,

This entry questions what it means to do research with an awareness of heteronormativity and considers how assuming gender and sexuality impacts research practices. From design and data collection to analysis and implementation, normative assumptions limit who and what is seen and heard, what questions are asked, how data are interpreted, and what impact research can have outside existing systems knowledge embedded in institutions and accounts.

1587,Hegemony and Heteronormativity,Revisiting 'The Political' in Queer Politics,María do Mar Castro Varela,"This book reflects on 'the political' in queer theory and politics by revisiting two of its key categories: hegemony and heteronormativity. It explores the specific insights offered by these categories and the ways in which they augment the analysis of power and domination from a queer perspective, whilst also examining the possibilities for political analysis and strategy-building provided by theories of hegemony and heteronormativity. Moreover, in addressing these issues the book strives to rethink the understanding of the term ""queer"", so as to avoid narrowing queer politics to a critique of normative heterosexuality and the rigid gender binary. By looking at the interplay between hegemony and heteronormativity, this ground-breaking volume presents new possibilities of reconceptualizing 'the political' from a queer perspective. Investigating the effects of queer politics not only on subjectivities and intimate personal relations, but also on institutions, socio-cultural processes and global politics, this book will be of interest to those working in the fields of critical theory, gender and sexuality, queer theory, postcolonial studies, and feminist political theory.",9781317122869,Hegemony and Heteronormativity Revisiting 'The Political' in Queer Politics
1589,"Gender, Heteronormativity, and the American Presidency",,Aidan Smith,"Gender, Heteronormativity and the American Presidency places notions of gender at the center of its analysis of presidential campaign communications. Over the decades, an investment in gendered representations of would-be leaders has changed little, in spite of the second- and third-wave feminist movements. Modern candidates have worked vigorously to demonstrate ""compensatory heterosexuality,"" an unquestionable normative identity that seeks to overcome challenges to their masculinity or femininity. The book draws from a wide range of archived media material, including televised films and advertisements, public debates and speeches, and candidate autobiographies. From the domestic ideals promoted by Eisenhower in the 1950s, right through to the explicit and divisive rhetoric associated with the Clinton/Trump race in 2016; intersectional content and discourse analysis reveals how each presidential candidate used his or her campaign to position themselves as a defender of traditional gender roles, and furthermore, how this investment in ""appropriate"" gender behaviour was made manifest in both international and domestic policy choices. This book represents a significant and timely contribution to the study of political communication. While communication during presidential elections is a well-established research field, Aidan Smith’s book is the first to apply a gendered lens over such an extended historical period and across the political spectrum.",9781351798792,
1591,Heteronormativity in a Rural School Community,An Autoethnography,Catherine Thompson-Lee,"This book presents an exploration of heteronormative discursive practices in the English countryside. A lesbian teacher describes her experiences in the rural school community in which she lived and worked. She prospered at the village school for almost ten years by censoring her sexuality and carefully managing the intersection between her private and professional identities. However, when a critical incident led to the exposure of her sexuality at school, she learned the extent to which the rural school community privileged and protected the heteronormative discourse. An autoethnographic method of inquiry provides intimate insight which is supported by external data, including email and text message correspondence. As the critical incident eventually became a police matter, police records and evidence from the UK Crown Prosecution Service were sought for use in the research. However, the collection of these data proved problematic, providing an unexpected development in the research and offering additional insight into the nature of rural life. This research offers a vivid insider perspective on the experiences of a lesbian teacher in a rural school community. It examines the incompatibility of private and professional identities, investigates the moral panic that surrounds teacher sexuality in schools and considers the impact of homophobic and heteronormative discursive practices on health, wellbeing and identity. Crucially, this research offers compelling insight into the steps that those in positions of power will take to protect and perpetuate the heteronormative discourse of rural life.",9789463009355,Heteronormativity in a Rural School Community An Autoethnography
1595,The Interruption of Heteronormativity in Higher Education,Critical Queer Pedagogies,Michael Seal,"This book examines how heteronormativity in higher education can be interrupted and resisted. Located within the theoretical framework of queer and critical pedagogy and based on extensive empirical research, the author explores the dynamics of heteronormativity and its interruption on professional courses in a range of higher education institutions. Reactions to attempt to interrupt it were nuanced: while strategies of contested engagement, avoidance and retreat were expressed, heterosexualities were largely un-examined and un-articulated. ‘Coming out’ needs to be a pedagogical act, carried out concurrently with the interruptions of other social constructions and binary oppositions. The author calls for co-created and co-held meta-reflexive and liminal spaces that emphasise inter-subjectivity, encounters, and working in the moment. These spaces must de-construct and reconstruct pedagogical power and knowledge to promote collective intersubjective consciousnesses, and widen the vision of the reflective practitioner to that of the pedagogical practitioner. This pioneering book is a call to action to all those concerned with interrupting and problematising presumed binary categories of sexuality within the heterosexual matrix.",9783030190897,The Interruption of Heteronormativity in Higher Education Critical Queer Pedagogies

Television talk shows, media articles and government press releases discuss not simply the problem of men, but have more recently focused on the problems of being a man. The Conundrum of Masculinity challenges highly advertised beliefs that men are in crisis and struggling to hold onto traditional masculine habits whilst the world around them changes. Indeed, whilst there is a range of valuable contributions to the field that examine how men live out their lives in different contexts, there are few accounts that examine in detail the building blocks of masculinity or how men are really ‘put together’. Thus, this innovative and timely volume seeks to provide a systematic exploration of the different aspects of masculinity – in particular hegemony, homosociality, homophobia and heteronormativity. An original approach to the field of masculinity studies, this book ultimately presents a critical synthesis that brings together disparate approaches to provide a clear and concise discussion to address the true nature of masculinity. The Conundrum of Masculinity will appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in fields such as Gender Studies, Masculinity Studies and Sociology.",9781317200529,"The Conundrum of Masculinity Hegemony, Homosociality, Homophobia and Heteronormativity"

Identifying the modernist, heteronormative understandings of the world implicit in the more popular models, this book employs queer theory to challenge these ideologies, drawing on disciplines both within and outside of counselling and psychology, as well as sociology, cultural studies and various ethnographic accounts. It highlights the dilemmas faced by those who may wish to practise as 'queer therapists', addressing not only therapeutic dilemmas, but also issues such as: identity, race, coming-out experiences, 'internalised homophobia', 'empathy', 'ethical issues', bisexuality and pathologisation. Comprising contributions from both academic experts and practitioners from the UK, USA and Australia, this book represents a new approach to counselling and psychotherapy that will appeal not only to sociologists and those working in the field of mental health, but also to scholars of race and ethnicity, gender, queer studies and queer theory.",9781317158943,Counselling Ideologies Queer Challenges to Heteronormativity
1606,"Inside and Outside: Heteronormativity, Gender, and Health in the Lives of Bi/Sexual Minority Youth",,Amanda Marie Pollitt,"N this two-manuscript dissertation, framed through queer and minority stress theories, I focus on heteronormative pressures and their impact on sexual identity fluidity and health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth and young adults. Heteronormativity, or the expectation to meet heterosexual norms in relationships, may be stressful for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth and be linked to poorer health. In particular, I focus on bisexual young people because bisexual people can enter into either same- or different-gender relationships; these young people could experience pressure from family members and religious communities to conform to heterosexual norms, resulting in sexual identity transitions that could explain health differences between sexual minority groups. In the first manuscript, I conducted life history narratives interviews with 14 racially and ethnically diverse youth and young adults between the ages of 18-24 on how LGB youth make sense of expectations to conform to heterosexual norms and how their experiences vary based on youths’ characteristics. In the second manuscript, I used structural equation modeling analysis of one of the largest community samples of LGB youth and young adults between the ages of 15-21 in the U.S. to examine youths' current and future relationship desires in a broader system of heteronormative expectations and how these expectations operate as mechanisms to influence the mental health of sexual minority youth. Qualitative results from the first manuscript show that for many youth and youth adults, gender and sexuality intersect to influence their experiences of heteronormativity: Gender and sexuality were conflated for gay men who stated that their gender nonconformity meant that family members already knew their sexuality before they came out as gay. Many bisexual women described their experiences being gender conforming in which they struggled to legitimize their sexuality to others because they were feminine. Though gay and lesbian identities were present in discussions of gender, an expression of gender that signaled and was named as bisexuality was fundamentally missing in the interviews. That is, participants did not describe a gender presentation that would indicate someone attracted to more than one gender. Participants consistently considered childbearing, but not marriage, to be highly desirable. Latino participants discussed heteronormativity through the racialized lens of machismo. However, religion was a greater source of pressure to conform to heterosexuality for Latino participants than were racial communities. My quantitative results from the second manuscript showed that gay men, lesbian women, and bisexual men are more likely to desire same-gender marriages later in life compared to bisexual women, who are more likely to desire different-gender marriages. Participants who desired different-gender marriage were more likely to identify as a different sexual identity over time. However, neither relationship desires nor sexual identity transitions related to depressive symptoms. The findings of this manuscript suggest that initial transition to a sexual minority identity may be the most vulnerable time for youth. After this initial transition, lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth may be inoculated to stress related to identity transitions, even in the context of heteronormativity. This research informs queer and minority stress theories: Gender, sexuality, and family norms intersect to structure how youth understand heteronormativity and predicts whether youth maintain their sexual identity, but such norms might not be stressors that influence health after youth first identify as LGB.",OCLC:1001259341,
1607,The Influence of Heteronormativity on Sexual Health Disparities in Queer and Heterosexual Women,,Jacqueline Bible,"This research focuses on identifying how heteronormativity moderates links between individual and interpersonal processes (i.e., communication self-efficacy, safe sex behaviors) that influence comprehensive sexual health (CSH) disparities among queer and heterosexual cisgender women. The World Health Organization (2019) defines CSH as well-being across physical, emotional, and social domains; yet, the extant literature often fails to consider determinants of, or disparities in, CSH. The first aim was to validate a measure of CSH and test its validity across online survey samples of queer and heterosexual women (N = 246) using a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis in MPLUS. Data fit the model (RMSEA= 0.06, CFI= 0.93) and some moderation was present. The second and third aims examined how heteronormativity moderates the links between communication self-efficacy, safe sex behaviors, and CSH in queer and heterosexual women, respectively. Among queer women, results suggested strong model fit (n=110; TLI=.96, CFI=.97, RMSEA=.04) and moderated, partial mediation was present. This also held true for heterosexual women (n=188, TLI=.96, CFI=.98, RMSEA=.04). Taken together, the latent construct of CSH can be measured parsimoniously, and it appears that the individual process of communication self-efficacy has a stronger direct effect on CSH compared to interpersonal processes. Heteronormativity moderated this relationship, particularly for women with high internalized heteronormativity. Thus, results provide a level of evidence explaining some impact of heteronormativity on CSH disparities among diverse women.",OCLC:1157318870,

1616,Straightforward,The Narrative Construction of Heteronormativity from Homer to The Hobbit,Marcus Attwater,"When asked to name an archetypal love story, most people will reply 'Romeo & Juliet', although some say 'Tristan & Isolde' instead. Very few will come up with a classical example, and the reason for this is simple: when you say archetypal, it is assumed you mean love between a man and a woman, and instances of this in classical accounts are rare. The reason for this is also not hard to find: as it does now, 'love' in the ancient world meant the affection of equals, and given the inferior position of women in Greek and Roman society, between the sexes is not usually where love is to be found. Straightforward examines how we got from there to here. It is a study not of the loves of real people, but of the ideal of love as it found expression in stories, stories which were often retold and reimagined by new generations and new cultures. By following these stories and the changes they underwent through the centuries Straightforward attempts to answer two related questions: 'When and why did the heterosexual ideal become normative in our narrative tradition?' and 'What was there before?' We begin in archaic Greece, with a story which was already old when Homer composed his epics...",9789403600383,Straightforward The Narrative Construction of Heteronormativity from Homer to The Hobbit
1618,"Heteronormativity, Patriarchy and the Nuclear Family Ideal",An Analysis of Queer Dutch Suburbia,H. Thompson,"This study uses feminist approaches to research and humanistic methods to understand the queer experience of Dutch suburban spaces. The core concepts of heteronormativity, patriarchy and the nuclear family ideal influence the way queer members of the suburban community experience and articulate romantic desires, the traditional gender labor divide and starting a family. This study finds that heteronormativity in suburban spaces promotes the privileging of heterosexuality in that participants felt that their queer sexuality reduced their chances of getting married. Additionally, it creates social scripts around romantic love so that the only viable option for a relationship is through monogamy. Patriarchy was shown to have limited impact in Dutch suburban spaces, as partners shared economic and domestic responsibilities. This could be because same-sex couples are not able to conform to normative gender roles; furthermore it could be related to high levels of gender equality experienced throughout the Netherlands. The nuclear family ideal is demonstrated to create discourses surrounding the correct way to be a parent, in which a good parent must dedicate their time to their children. However, for same-sex couples there are a series of complications and difficulties when starting a family which must be considered. Finally, this study looks at the exclusion and discrimination faced by queer participants in suburban spaces. This created a divide among participants which is demonstrated to be created by age and environment. Participants from Purmerend who were younger found suburban spaces to be constricting, and the urban environment to be open and accepting where participants from Ijburg, who were older, found the opposite.",OCLC:1098269496,"Heteronormativity, Patriarchy and the Nuclear Family Ideal An Analysis of Queer Dutch Suburbia"

Moreover, the housing crisis differentially affects particular demographics and communities. Although these phenomena have been well-documented in Vancouver, few have analyzed this growing concern through the lens of queer theory. Using archival data such as planning documents, newspapers, and policy reports, I trace a chronology of Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) housing policy and discourse in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside through the analytic of heteronormativity. I argue that heteronormativity has remained an underlying principle in the formulation and execution of SRO housing policy, though its manifestation varies with the changing political economy. Furthermore, my analysis indicates that neoliberal and heteronormative housing policy uniquely affects particular figures such as the LGBTQ+ individual, the racialized subject, youth, working mothers, and the aging bachelor, all of which are unable to fulfill the heteronormative demographic and class duties of “Canadiana.” My research provides a queer material framework for analyzing the housing crisis and urban geographical issues across various scales of governance.

Through semi-structured interviews five teachers had a chance to share their experiences and bring voice to an often, silenced topic.

1629,Eliminating Heteronormativity and Creating Positive School Climates for LGBTQ Youth in K-12 Schools,,Dana Elizabeth Fate,"Developing an LGBTQ identity may be difficult for youth to do, as they grow up in a society that assumes heterosexual to be “normal” and often adheres to strict gender roles. As a result, when LGBTQ youth begin to form their sexual minority identity, they may face numerous challenges. This may lead them to engage in risk behaviors and puts them at an increased danger for suicide. Risk factors and protective factors both exist, which may prove to be the key to understanding what can be changed or supported to best help this population. By implementing multicultural education strategies in K-12 schools, heteronormativity and heterosexism may be addressed early on in children’s lives, while continuing to support differences as students become aware of their sexual identity.

This book continues Trentham's commitment to challenging homophobia and heterosexism in and through education and follows Atkinson and DePalma's account of sexualities equality in children's worlds in school and beyond: Invisible Boundaries - addressing sexualities equality in children's world. In ""Interrogating Normativity"" they and their colleagues from the ESRC-funded No Outsiders research team explore and analyse central issues which permeate the team's challenge to gender conformity through primary education. The need for primary teachers and other professionals working with children to address equality in relation to sexual orientation and gender expression is becoming increasingly urgent in the light of recent changes in UK legislation. The Civil Partnership Act (2006), the Equality Act (2007) and new legislative requirements for ensuring the active promotion of child wellbeing, gender equality and community cohesion all place demands on schools and support services which they are ill-equipped to meet. This book fills a gap by examining how we might go about addressing these demands.

1632,Heteronormativity and Its Effect on School Belonging,A Narrative Inquiry of Recent Gender and Sexuality Diverse Graduates,Elizabeth Marie Gannon-Rittenhouse,"Gender and sexuality diverse (GSD) high school students in the United States often feel alienated from their classmates due to heteronormative policies, curriculum, and climate, causing them to have higher rates of victimization, suicide and suicide ideation, failure to graduation, absenteeism, and drug use than their classmates. These students often cannot find representation in the curriculum or among the adults who work with them and often feel unsupported by their classmates and teachers. This study sought to determine, through the narratives of five recent GSD graduates, how heteronormativity affects GSD students and what supports can be put in place or strengthened to support GSD students at one central Pennsylvania high school. Through a participatory/advocacy approach, this study gathered the experiences of four GSD graduates of a high school in central Pennsylvania through narrative interviews and focus groups. Through these interviews, the researcher developed an analysis of the school culture from the perspective of GSD students by collecting, identifying, and analyzing heteronormative school policies and interviewing administration to gauge the understanding of GSD student issues and the need for further training and professional development. Through coding, themes of safety, belonging, and self-esteem were identified and analyzed. Recommendations are given to help the school district, building administration, faculty, and Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) create a greater sense of school belonging for GSD and all students. Student narratives illustrate the struggles that GSD students face, as well as their triumphs in finding a place to belong and gaining a sense of identity and confidence as students and young adults.

The study also examines the ways that the Quebec Education Program supports hegemonic norms of heteronormativity. The eight participants were either currently enrolled in the McGill Bachelors of Kindergarten/Elementary Education or had graduated in 2017. Five pre-service teachers, and three recent graduates participated in focus groups that explored their experiences, attitudes, knowledge and beliefs about gender and sexuality within the elementary school classroom. They were questioned about the importance they associated with creating safe spaces for children to explore their gender identity and sexuality, the place that they saw these topics taking up in their B.Ed. program at McGill, as well as their familiarity with the Quebec Education Program with reference to these topics. The participants were asked to pinpoint experiences in the B. Ed program that disrupted or supported the construction of heteronormative narratives in teacher practices; identify teacher practices they had observed that supported heteronormativity; identify barriers to engaging in a disruption of heteronormativity; and identify ways that pre-service teachers could be better prepared to address these topics in and elementary school classroom. A variety of theoretical lenses are used throughout this research project including queer theory, feminist theory and post-structuralism. The themes found in the data include: the ease of relying on the gender binary; the need to create safe(r) spaces; isolated experiences of learning about the topics of gender and sexuality; the McGill program lacking info; and the need for the training to be mandatory. The implications of the results include suggestions for teacher practices that will allow for the creation of safe(r) spaces that allow for the disruption of heteronormativity, as well as ways for a Bachelor of Education program to better prepare their pre-service teachers to address these topics with their students.

1639,"Drag Queens, Mascara, and Family... Oh, My!",Challenging Heteronormativity in the Musical La Cage Aux Follies,Janice Marie Ventura,"Whether the characters portrayed in musical theater are fictional or non-fictional, they reflect how human beings interact and react to one another within a societal milieu. What then, does this say about us as people and the society we live in? A musical that yields a fascinating response to these questions is the 1983 musical, La Cage aux Folles. Through textual analysis, this thesis demonstrates how the characters in La Cage reflect a number of issues revolving around societal discrimination and forced separatism against individuals identifying as queer (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual or any individual identifying outside the guise of normative standards). The prejudice experienced by these characters is inflicted solely on the basis of their sexual preference and identification with queer culture. This thesis demonstrates how La Cage reflects the consciousness of queer characters as queer human beings in a society dominated by heterosexual hegemony. The theoretical framework utilized in this thesis derives from Queer theory, Feminist theory, and Feminist theater. It is through this framework that the following postulations about La Cage have been formulated and proven: first, La Cage is a musical production in which its script is characterized by consciousness of queer characters as queer human beings; second, La Cage contains scripted performances that demonstrate sexual differences among characters despite biological sex and thus undermines the dominative thought that heteronormativity is the sole power in society; and, lastly, La Cage challenges the recognition of heteronormativity. The combined analysis of these postulations proves that La Cage is a musical with political purpose, containing an activist viewpoint that acts as a call for societal evaluation. Ultimately, the musical points out a series of dismal truths in society that were prevalent in the 1980s, and as exemplified, are still identifiable in the present.",OCLC:849936161,"Drag Queens, Mascara, and Family...

As passionately attached to faith and freedom as ever, she warns that our addiction to outrage has debased our politics and reduced us to a vicious tribalism. The antidote to outrage is grace—a generous and forgiving spirit that tolerates those with whom one disagrees and offers redemption to the offender. But grace is hard even under the best conditions, and leftist rage mobs have stoked the fires of anger so assiduously—with help from some of their foes on the right—that grace is almost impossible. Fortunately, as Dana reminds us, grace comes from God, who specializes in the impossible. In Grace Canceled, Dana Loesch explains: • How America got cut up into competing tribes • Why a society without grace falls for socialism • Why outrage makes us dumb • How violence became an acceptable political tactic on the left • When anger is called for and when it's just self-indulgence • The three golden rules of a happy warrior Make no mistake: our freedom, our faith, our very way of life are under attack. The stakes are incredibly high, and Dana doesn't pretend they aren't. But the social justice warriors are already slaves of outrage, and if the rest of us become slaves as well, then no one wins.",9781684510443,"Grace Canceled How Outrage is Destroying Lives, Ending Debate, and Endangering Democracy"

While some of the subjects are familiar names in spaceflight history, the accounts of others are told here for the first time. Colin Burgess features spaceflight candidates from the United States, Russia, Indonesia, Australia, and Great Britain. Shattered Dreams brings to new life such episodes and upheavals in spaceflight history as the saga of the three Apollo missions that were cancelled due to budgetary constraints and never flew; NASA astronaut Patricia Hilliard Robertson, who died of burn injuries after her airplane crashed before she had a chance to fly into space; and a female cosmonaut who might have become the first journalist to fly in space. Another NASA astronaut was preparing to fly an Apollo mission before he was diagnosed with a disqualifying illness. There is also the amazing story of the pilot who could have bailed out of his damaged aircraft but held off while heroically avoiding a populated area and later applied to NASA to fulfill his cherished dream of becoming an astronaut despite having lost both legs in the accident. These are the incredibly human stories of competitive realists fired with an unquenchable passion. Their accounts reveal in their own words—and those of others close to them—how their shared ambition would go awry through personal accidents, illness, the Challenger disaster, death, or other circumstances.",9781496206756,Shattered Dreams The Lost and Canceled Space Missions

Long ago this had been the capital city of China. Few speak English here, which gives a flavor to travel that Charlie and Sally love. Communication still transpires, but with few words and many hand gestures and laughter. Sometimes this lack of a common language puts them into odd and even trying situations. For example, what does one do when the last bus leaves right now and you had planned to be in the mountains for many hours? How do you order food when you have no menu you can read? And when a car is following you up on the sidewalk, what exactly is the proper custom to follow? The phone translator was quite useful, except that it did not understand Charlie's Texan accent. How does one answer the question: Now that you have been to China, do you feel poor? And just what exactly is in the teapot if not tea? As one thing after another is canceled in one form or another, what does one do when the airlines cancel a flight?

Department of Health and Human Services,"Medicare Part A provides, among other things, inpatient hospital insurance benefits and coverage of extended care services for beneficiaries after they are discharged from hospitals. In calendar years (CYs) 2009 and 2010, Medicare made Part A prospective payments to hospitals of $597 million for inpatient claims that involved a canceled elective surgery. Almost $55 million involved short-stay (2 days or fewer) claims. When an inpatient hospital admission is based on the expectation that a patient will have elective surgery but that surgery does not occur, that cancellation would generally make the admission not reasonable and necessary. Our reviews at several hospitals indicated that short-stay inpatient claims involving canceled elective surgeries often did not meet Medicare requirements for Part A prospective payments because the admissions were not reasonable and necessary. We, therefore, extended our review of Medicare payments for inpatient short-stay claims involving canceled elective surgeries to hospitals nationwide. Our objective was to determine whether inpatient admissions related to short-stay hospital claims involving canceled elective surgeries were reasonable and necessary.",1500580198,

1951,Trans* in College,Transgender Students' Strategies for Navigating Campus Life and the Institutional Politics of Inclusion,Z Nicolazzo,"WINNER of 2017 AERA DIVISION J OUTSTANDING PUBLICATION AWARD This is both a personal book that offers an account of the author’s own trans* identity and a deeply engaged study of trans* collegians that reveals the complexities of trans* identities, and how these students navigate the trans* oppression present throughout society and their institutions, create community and resilience, and establish meaning and control in a world that assumes binary genders. This book is addressed as much to trans* students themselves – offering them a frame to understand the genders that mark them as different and to address the feelings brought on by the weight of that difference – as it is to faculty, student affairs professionals, and college administrators, opening up the implications for the classroom and the wider campus. This book not only remedies the paucity of literature on trans* college students, but does so from a perspective of resiliency and agency. Rather than situating trans* students as problems requiring accommodation, this book problematizes the college environment and frames trans* students as resilient individuals capable of participating in supportive communities and kinship networks, and of developing strategies to promote their own success. Z Nicolazzo provides the reader with a nuanced and illuminating review of the literature on gender and sexuality that sheds light on the multiplicity of potential expressions and outward representations of trans* identity as a prelude to the ethnography ze conducted with nine trans* collegians that richly documents their interactions with, and responses to, environments ranging from the unwittingly offensive to explicitly antagonistic. The book concludes by giving space to the study’s participants to themselves share what they want college faculty, staff, and students to know about their lived experiences. Two appendices respectively provide a glossary of vocabulary and terms to address commonly asked questions, and a description of the study design, offered as guide for others considering working alongside marginalized population in a manner that foregrounds ethics, care, and reciprocity.",9781620364581,Trans* in College Transgender Students' Strategies for Navigating Campus Life and the Institutional Politics of Inclusion
1953,Normal Life,"Administrative Violence, Critical Trans Politics, and the Limits of Law",Dean Spade,"Revised and Expanded Edition Wait—what's wrong with rights? It is usually assumed that trans and gender nonconforming people should follow the civil rights and ""equality"" strategies of lesbian and gay rights organizations by agitating for legal reforms that would ostensibly guarantee nondiscrimination and equal protection under the law. This approach assumes that the best way to address the poverty and criminalization that plague trans populations is to gain legal recognition and inclusion in the state's institutions. But is this strategy effective? In Normal Life Dean Spade presents revelatory critiques of the legal equality framework for social change, and points to examples of transformative grassroots trans activism that is raising demands that go beyond traditional civil rights reforms. Spade explodes assumptions about what legal rights can do for marginalized populations, and describes transformative resistance processes and formations that address the root causes of harm and violence. In the new afterword to this revised and expanded edition, Spade notes the rapid mainstreaming of trans politics and finds that his predictions that gaining legal recognition will fail to benefit trans populations are coming to fruition. Spade examines recent efforts by the Obama administration and trans equality advocates to ""pinkwash"" state violence by articulating the US military and prison systems as sites for trans inclusion reforms. In the context of recent increased mainstream visibility of trans people and trans politics, Spade continues to advocate for the dismantling of systems of state violence that shorten the lives of trans people.

These days, it is practically impossible not to hear about some aspect of transgender life.

Focusing discerningly on the encounter of transpersons with the apparatuses that constitute the prison industrial complex, the contributors to this volume create new frameworks and new vocabularies that surely will have a transformative impact on the theories and practices of twenty-first century abolition."" —Angela Y. Davis, professor emerita, University of California, Santa Cruz ""The contributors to Captive Genders brilliantly shatter the assumption that the antidote to danger is human sacrifice. In other words, for these thinkers: where life is precious life is precious."" —Ruth Wilson Gilmore, author of Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California ""Captive Genders is at once a scathing and necessary analysis of the prison industrial complex and a history of queer resistance to state tyranny. By analyzing the root causes of anti-queer and anti-trans violence, this book exposes the brutality of state control over queer/trans bodies inside and outside prison walls, and proposes an analytical framework for undoing not just the prison system, but its mechanisms of surveillance, dehumanization and containment. —Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, author of Why Are Faggots So Afraid of Faggots?

1965,Trans People in Higher Education,,Genny Beemyn,"Addresses the experiences of trans college students, faculty, and staff in a single volume for the first time. While more trans students, faculty, and staff have come out on US college campuses today than ever before, many still report enduring harassment and discrimination. Others avoid disclosing their gender identity because they do not feel safe or comfortable at their schools. This groundbreaking book is the first to address their experiences in a single volume. Genny Beemyn brings together personal narratives and original research to give readers both individual and large-scale perspectives, which provide unprecedented insight into the experiences of trans people in higher education. These contributions reveal that despite an improving environment, trans people continue to face widespread interpersonal and institutional opposition on campuses across the country. Some of the first published research focusing on nonbinary trans undergraduates and trans graduate students is included here, in addition to the most comprehensive research to date of trans students at womens colleges and of trans academics. Trans People in Higher Education also examines the sexual health of trans students, the treatment of trans people by individuals with institutional authority, and the strategies and lessons learned from one college that successfully became more trans inclusive. Weaving personal narratives and research studies together in ways that highlight the full diversity of trans individuals, Trans People in Higher Education serves as an urgent call to action for higher education to play a leadership role in catalyzing broad social change around trans rights. In the process, Beemyn offers an invaluable resource for creating a trans-welcoming and trans-supportive environment on college and university campuses.  Lynn Pasquerella, President, Association of American Colleges and Universities PRAISE FOR TRANS PEOPLE IN HIGHER EDUCATION Beemyns advocacy and research on trans people in higher education is groundbreaking, and this edited volume is no exception. Through a mix of narratives and personal accounts, as well as the findings of research studies by major scholars in the field, the book paints a rich portrait of the variety of trans identities and experiences on college campuses today, along with recommendations for how campuses can create a more inclusive environment. The volume is an extraordinary resource for all who are committed to creating campus communities that are welcoming and affirming for trans students, faculty, and staff, and for those who simply want to learn more about the experiences of trans people on college campuses today.  Kristin G. Esterberg, President, State University of New York at Potsdam For more than two decades, Genny Beemyn has been at the forefront of higher education research and policy advocacy regarding trans issues. Beemyn has given us yet another stellar contribution to those fields with this new anthology,which showcases an impressive cohort of emerging voices as well as a burgeoning body of high-quality scholarship. Its the best, most comprehensive overview to date on the timely topics it addresses.  Susan Stryker, author of Transgender History, Revised Edition: The Roots of Todays Revolution Trans People in Higher Education combines the powerful accessibility of compelling personal stories with the complex and often harsh findings of qualitative and quantitative research to demonstrate the continued need for trans-affirming campuses, from policy to classroom engagement. Despite more than two decades of positive changes in academic institutions, trans and nonbinary students, faculty, and staff continue to struggle for acceptance and equal access. This timely book shows that, in challenging the constricts of the binary gender system, helping others develop skills for culturally competent interactions, and expanding campus-wide policies, these individuals offer academia the best gift of all: learning opportunities and the inspiration to do better.  Willy Wilkinson, author of Born on the Edge of Race and Gender: A Voice for Cultural Competency",9781438472751,

1975,The Trans Generation,How Trans Kids (and Their Parents) are Creating a Gender Revolution,Ann Travers,"Winner, 2019 PROSE Award for Anthropology, Criminology and Anthropology, presented by the Association of American Publishers A groundbreaking look at the lives of transgender children and their families Some “boys” will only wear dresses; some “girls” refuse to wear dresses; in both cases, as Ann Travers shows in this fascinating account of the lives of transgender kids, these are often more than just wardrobe choices. Travers shows that from very early ages, some at two and three years old, these kids find themselves to be different from the sex category that was assigned to them at birth. How they make their voices heard—to their parents and friends, in schools, in public spaces, and through the courts—is the focus of this remarkable and groundbreaking book. Based on interviews with transgender kids, ranging in age from 4 to 20, and their parents, and over five years of research in the US and Canada, The Trans Generation offers a rare look into what it is like to grow up as a trans child. From daycare to birthday parties and from the playground to the school bathroom, Travers takes the reader inside the day-to-day realities of trans kids who regularly experience crisis as a result of the restrictive ways in which sex categories regulate their lives and put pressure on them to deny their internal sense of who they are in gendered terms. As a transgender activist and as an advocate for trans kids, Travers is able to document from first-hand experience the difficulties of growing up trans and the challenges that parents can face. The book shows the incredible time, energy, and love that these parents give to their children, even in the face of, at times, unsupportive communities, schools, courts, health systems, and government laws. Keeping in mind that all trans kids are among the most vulnerable to bullying, violent attacks, self-harm, and suicide, and that those who struggle with poverty, racism, lack of parental support, learning differences, etc, are extremely at risk, Travers offers ways to support all trans kids through policy recommendations and activist interventions. Ultimately, the book is meant to open up options for kids’ own gender self-determination, to question the need for the sex binary, and to highlight ways that cultural and material resources can be redistributed more equitably. The Trans Generation offers an essential and important new understanding of childhood.",9781479832354,The Trans Generation How Trans Kids (and Their Parents) are Creating a Gender Revolution
1977,Beyond Trans,Does Gender Matter?,Heath Fogg Davis,"Goes beyond transgender to question the need for gender classification. Beyond Trans pushes the conversation on gender identity to its limits: questioning the need for gender categories in the first place. Whether on birth certificates or college admissions applications or on bathroom doors, why do we need to mark people and places with sex categories? Do they serve a real purpose or are these places and forms just mechanisms of exclusion? Heath Fogg Davis offers an impassioned call to rethink the usefulness of dividing the world into not just Male and Female categories but even additional categories of Transgender and gender fluid. Davis, himself a transgender man, explores the underlying gender-enforcing policies and customs in American life that have led to transgender bathroom bills, college admissions controversies, and more, arguing that it is necessary for our society to take real steps to challenge the assumption that gender matters. He examines four areas where we need to re-think our sex-classification systems: sex-marked identity documents such as birth certificates, driver’s licenses and passports; sex-segregated public restrooms; single-sex colleges; and sex-segregated sports. Speaking from his own experience and drawing upon major cases of sex discrimination in the news and in the courts, Davis presents a persuasive case for challenging how individuals are classified according to sex and offers concrete recommendations for alleviating sex identity discrimination and sex-based disadvantage. For anyone in search of pragmatic ways to make our world more inclusive, Davis’ recommendations provide much-needed practical guidance about how to work through this complex issue. A provocative call to action, Beyond Trans pushes us to think how we can work to make America truly inclusive of all people.",9781479824120,Beyond Trans Does Gender Matter?

1989,Brown Trans Figurations,"Rethinking Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Chicanx/Latinx Studies",Francisco J. Galarte,"Within queer, transgender, and Latinx and Chicanx cultural politics, brown transgender narratives are frequently silenced and erased. Brown trans subjects are treated as deceptive, unnatural, nonexistent, or impossible, their bodies, lives, and material circumstances represented through tropes and used as metaphors. Restoring personhood and agency to these subjects, Francisco J. Galarte advances “brown trans figuration” as a theoretical framework to describe how transness and brownness coexist within the larger queer, trans, and Latinx historical experiences. Brown Trans Figurations presents a collection of representations that reveal the repression of brown trans narratives and make that repression visible and palpable. Galarte examines the violent deaths of two transgender Latinas and the corresponding narratives that emerged about their lives, analyzes the invisibility of brown transmasculinity in Chicana feminist works, and explores how issues such as transgender politics can be imagined as part of Chicanx and Latinx political movements. This book considers the contexts in which brown trans narratives appear, how they circulate, and how they are reproduced in politics, sexual cultures, and racialized economies.",9781477322154,"Brown Trans Figurations Rethinking Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Chicanx/Latinx Studies"
1991,Black on Both Sides,A Racial History of Trans Identity,C. Riley Snorton,"The story of Christine Jorgensen, America’s first prominent transsexual, famously narrated trans embodiment in the postwar era. Her celebrity, however, has obscured other mid-century trans narratives—ones lived by African Americans such as Lucy Hicks Anderson and James McHarris. Their erasure from trans history masks the profound ways race has figured prominently in the construction and representation of transgender subjects. In Black on Both Sides, C. Riley Snorton identifies multiple intersections between blackness and transness from the mid-nineteenth century to present-day anti-black and anti-trans legislation and violence. Drawing on a deep and varied archive of materials—early sexological texts, fugitive slave narratives, Afro-modernist literature, sensationalist journalism, Hollywood films—Snorton attends to how slavery and the production of racialized gender provided the foundations for an understanding of gender as mutable. In tracing the twinned genealogies of blackness and transness, Snorton follows multiple trajectories, from the medical experiments conducted on enslaved black women by J. Marion Sims, the “father of American gynecology,” to the negation of blackness that makes transnormativity possible. Revealing instances of personal sovereignty among blacks living in the antebellum North that were mapped in terms of “cross dressing” and canonical black literary works that express black men’s access to the “female within,” Black on Both Sides concludes with a reading of the fate of Phillip DeVine, who was murdered alongside Brandon Teena in 1993, a fact omitted from the film Boys Don’t Cry out of narrative convenience. Reconstructing these theoretical and historical trajectories furthers our imaginative capacities to conceive more livable black and trans worlds.",9781452955858,Black on Both Sides A Racial History of Trans Identity

With attention to the question of how trans has shaped and been shaped by new modes of social action and networking, The Emergence of Trans also explores what the proliferation of trans representation across multiple media forms and public discourse suggests about the wider cultural moment, and considers the challenges presented for health care, social policy, gender and sexuality theory, and everyday articulations of identity. As such, it will appeal to scholars and students of gender and sexuality studies, as well as activists, professionals and individuals interested in trans lives and discourses.",9781351381550,"The Emergence of Trans Cultures, Politics and Everyday Lives"

2011,Trans,A Memoir,Juliet Jacques,"Moving memoir and insightful examination of transgender politics “Six weeks before sex reassignment surgery (SRS), I am obliged to stop taking my hormones. I suddenly feel very differently about my forthcoming operation.” In July 2012, aged thirty, Juliet Jacques underwent sex reassignment surgery—a process she chronicled with unflinching honesty in a serialised national newspaper column. Trans tells of her life to the present moment: a story of growing up, of defining yourself, and of the rapidly changing world of gender politics. Fresh from university, eager to escape a dead-end job, she launches a career as a writer in a publishing culture dominated by London cliques and still figuring out the impact of the Internet. She navigates the treacherous waters of a world where, even in the liberal and feminist media, transgender identities go unacknowledged, misunderstood or worse. Yet through art, film, music, politics and football, Jacques starts to become the person she had only imagined, and begins the process of transition. Interweaving the personal with the political, her memoir is a powerful exploration of debates that comprise trans politics, issues which promise to redefine our understanding of what it means to be alive. Revealing, honest, humorous, and self-deprecating, Trans includes an epilogue with Sheila Heti, author of How Should a Person Be?, in which Jacques and Heti discuss the cruxes of writing and identity.

Yet even from the very beginning of American motorsports, the companies that became AMC had some serious involvement in motorsport. From the early Nash and Hudson models all the way through the muscle car era, AMC had direct involvement in racing.
