16,"Ecological Migration, Development and Transformation",A Study of Migration and Poverty Reduction in Ningxia,Peilin Li,"After over 30 years of reform and opening up, China’s aggregate economic volume is now the second largest in the world. Over the past decade many provinces in the western region of China have implemented ecological migration projects of different scales, which have attracted considerable attention both in China and abroad. The projects indicate, first, that there is an urgent need for this type of endeavor: whether the goal is to reduce poverty or to protect the environment, we need to move the poor populations out of the ecologically fragile regions. Secondly, the projects indicate that the Chinese government is capable of meeting this need. Migration projects are complex and costly and without sufficient financial resources and systematic planning, migration may fail to reduce poverty, and could even aggravate it. The rapid economic growth in China, however, makes such migration projects viable.",9783662473665,"Ecological Migration, Development and Transformation A Study of Migration and Poverty Reduction in Ningxia"
19,"Social Security, Demographics, and Risk",,Christoph Hendrik Borgmann,"This volume addresses the most important issues of the ongoing discussion on designing social security. It provides fundamental results for pay-as-you-go social security, covers the issues of social security during demographic transition and examines the inclusion of risk aspects into the analysis of social security. An empirical case study of Germany yields the surprising result that de facto the German public pension scheme already comprises an implicit demographic factor. This book allows a subtle understanding of how interacting risks are treated within different pension systems and thereby provides a basis for the development of innovative ways of risk sharing.",9783540266976,

47,The Modern Rise of Population,,Thomas McKeown,"“One of the truly important books of our time.” The modern rise of population is one of the great themes of history. Ten thousand years ago thee were less than 10 million people in the world. By 1750 there were 750 million and, from that time to the present, the growth has continued at a rapid and ever advancingrate. World population reached 1,000 million in 1830, 2,000 million a century later, and today exceeds 4,000 million. Although the phenomenon has received considerable attention, interest has centered on its iplications for the future and the causes have been neglected. This study rights the balance. The approach is both novel and comprehensive, and the conclusions are controversial. The author challenges manu common assumptions and argues, for instance, that the health of man ‘is only marginally influenced by personal medical care’. Notable for its grasp of complex and biological and medical issues and for its lucid style, this is a thorough interpretation of a subject which must concern us all.” — Publisher description.",UOM:39015046400688,

62,American Corrections,Concepts and Controversies,Barry A. Krisberg,"American Corrections, Second Edition offers you a contemporary, issues-oriented introduction that covers every aspect of corrections, prompting you to think critically about complex issues that are affecting the current U.S. correctional system. Incorporating the most recent theory, research, and data available, the Second Edition encourages you to explore the most interesting and progressive developments in correctional policy and practice. Authors Barry A. Krisberg, Susan Marchionna, and Christopher J. Hartney draw from years of professional experience to give you a practical knowledge of corrections, as well as provide a framework for thoughtful analysis into what is plaguing the American correctional system and a realistic exploration of the solutions that could make a difference. New to the Second Edition: Up-to-date coverage of today’s key issues reflects the latest developments in corrections, including the fiscal impact of corrections, reforms in corrections, and an expanded use of alternatives to incarceration. Debates around the effectiveness of corrections encourage you to think critically about probation, problem-solving courts, split sentences and flash incarceration, new recidivism studies, rates of racial and ethnic disparity in adult and juvenile corrections, and overrepresentation of youth of color in prisons. Recent trends are discussed to give you a clearer picture of how the correctional system has transformed over the years, including the decline in the practice of incarcerating juveniles in large prisons, the rising incarceration rate for women, the treatment of mentally ill inmates, the increase of private prisons, and more. Incisive exploration of policies proposed by the Trump administration shows you how the current administration’s approach differs from Obama-era sentencing reforms and encourages students to think critically about the potent impacts on the correctional system. New Spotlight boxes introduce you to key issues such as immigration and detention and the opioid addiction epidemic. Updated references, statistics, court rulings, and data help you understand the latest trends in correctional practices.",9781544318240,American Corrections Concepts and Controversies
64,UPSC Prelims and Mains Exam 2020: Subject Wise Current Affairs,,R P Meena,"UPSC Prelims and Mains Exam 2020: Subject Wise Current Affairs UPSC Prelims and Mains Exam 2020 : Subject Wise Current Affairs Important / Trending topics for IAS Exam.Subject Wise Current Affairs is an effort to make current affairs available in a more organized manner in accordance with the UPSC Exam Syllabus. Current affairs are of course the most important aspect in Civil services Exam preparation. We should always analyse Current affairs from the UPSC preliminary exam and the UPSC mains exam perspective.No matter which subject UPSC asks questions from (economics, environment, History or from polity), it makes conscious efforts to link the subject to a current affair topic. It thus becomes an imperative for us to know what the term current affairs really mean from UPSC point of view. You can get a proper understanding through the analysis of the previous year question papers.If we examine the question papers from 2013 onwards till 2019 preliminary exam, almost close to 50-60% of the questions were asked from topics that are of current relevance. The number of questions based on Current Affairs varies from year to year.The logic behind such a shift in the pattern of question papers explains the intent of UPSC and its quest to have brightest minds to govern the country. However, for the quest to be fruitful it would be appropriate from the part of UPSC to examine the candidate’s awareness about the society in which he is living. Static knowledge would prove inefficient for such an analysis. Society is dynamic and is subjected to changes. A Civil Servant should have the skills of a barrister and also that of a diplomat in order to cope with the changing society and also show the cognitive skills to coordinate, mobilize arguments and achieve consensus in regard to the execution of his duty. This analytical nature of the duty demands the UPSC aspirants to have an analytical mind and awareness of the society. #upscexam2020 #iasexam2020 #iastrendingtopics #upsctrendingtopics #iasexam2020currentaffairs #upscexam2020currentaffairs #topicsprelims2020 #topicsmainsexam2020",,
66,Liberty or Lockdown,,Jeffrey Tucker,"Jeffrey Tucker is well known as the author of many informative and beloved articles and books on the subject of human freedom. Now he’s turned his attention to the most shocking and widespread violation of human freedom in our times: the authoritarian lockdown of society on the pretense that it is necessary in the face of a novel virus. Learning from the experts, Jeffrey Tucker has researched this subject from every angle. In this book, Tucker lays out the history, politics, economics, and science relevant to the coronavirus response. The result is clear: there is no justification for the lockdowns. It’s liberty or lockdown. We have to choose. The book includes a foreword by George Gilder.",9781630692124,

69,Surviving Lockdown,Human Nature in Social Isolation,David Cohen,"2020 has been the year of the virus, and it will not be a mere footnote in history. This book reflects on the unprecedented changes to our lives and the impact on our behaviour as we lived through social isolation during the global COVID-19 pandemic. From sociable creatures of habit, we were forced into a period of uncertainty, restriction and risk, physically separated from families and friends. Packed with guidance and coping strategies for lockdown, this book, authored by top psychologist David Cohen, explores the impact of this widespread quarantine on our relationships, our children, our mental health and our daily lives. Benedictine monks, hermit popes, Dorothy Sayers, Daniel Defoe (who made the isolated Robinson Crusoe a hero), Sigmund Freud and a rabbi’s angry dog are all among the cast of characters as we are taken on a whistle-stop tour through plagues in history and brain science, to the importance of introspection and how to make meaning from lockdown. In his trademark entertaining style, Cohen examines the psychology behind our behaviour during this unusual time to discover what we can learn about human nature, what lessons we can learn for the future – and whether we will apply them.",9781000225662,Surviving Lockdown Human Nature in Social Isolation

95,Sales Losses in the First Quarter of the COVID-19 Pandemic,Evidence from California Administrative Data,Robert W. Fairlie,"COVID-19 led to a massive shutdown of businesses in the second quarter of 2020. Estimates from the CPS, for example, indicate that the number of active business owners dropped by 22 percent from February to April 2020. In this descriptive research note, we provide the first analysis of losses in sales and revenues among the universe of businesses in California using administrative data from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. The losses in sales average 17 percent in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the second quarter of 2019 even though year-over-year sales typically grow by 3-4 percent. We find that sales losses were largest in businesses affected by mandatory lockdowns such as Accommodations, which lost 91 percent, whereas online sales grew by 180 percent. Losses also differed substantially across counties with large losses in San Francisco (50 percent) and Los Angeles (24 percent) whereas some counties experienced small gains in sales. Placing business types into different categories based on whether they were essential or non-essential (and thus subject to early lockdowns) and whether they have a moderate or high level of person-to-person contact, we find interesting correlations between sales losses and COVID-19 cases per capita across counties in California. The results suggest that local implementation and enforcement of lockdown restrictions and voluntary behavioral responses as reactions to the perceived local COVID-19 spread both played a role, but enforcement of mandatory restrictions may have had a larger impact on sales losses.",OCLC:1235879118,Sales Losses in the First Quarter of the COVID-19 Pandemic Evidence from California Administrative Data

Human Facial Expression is suitable for graduate and advanced undergraduate use as a text or course supplement. Chapters on the history of interpreting facial expressions, and on Darwin's contributions, set the stage for a thorough discussion of modern evolutionary theory and the biological, cultural, and developmental origins of our facial expressions.

278,Climbing the Walls,,Kieran Cunningham,"When mountains are your salvation, what keep your mental weather calm and free of storms, how do you cope if they’re out of reach? After spending a decade restlessly globetrotting in search of a way of life that worked for him, journalist Kieran Cunningham alighted on Sondrio, a small town in Lombardy, Italy. A stone’s throw from the Alps, there he found the perfect combination of fresh mountain air, a strong network of local friends and lots of climbing. Finally he was able to accept and manage his diagnosis of Bipolar 1. And then Lombardy found itself the European epicentre of Covid-19 and subject to the strictest of lockdowns. What does a climber do when his beloved peaks are off limits? When he’s only permitted to leave the house for his weekly sanctioned grocery shop? When all the things that help him maintain his delicate equilibrium are taken away? As Kieran feels his mental health begin to crumble, he looks desperately for something he can climb to help rid him of his excess energy and hopefully get him back on track. Kieran finds himself navigating the walls of his house over and over while gazing at the mountain ranges so tantalisingly close. He dreams of that first euphoric climb – alone in the clouds, tired, happy, sated. Climbing the Walls is a memoir about mental health and the power of nature and exercise. It’s both a devastatingly honest account of living with Bipolar 1 and a love song to small-town Italian life and the high places that keep him healthy.",9781398500211,
295,Italian Workers at Risk During the Covid-19 Epidemic,,Teresa Barbieri,"We analyse the content of Italian occupations operating in about 600 sectors with a focus on the dimensions that expose workers to contagion risks during the COVID-19 epidemics. To do so we leverage extremely detailed and granular information from ICP, the Italian equivalent of O*Net. We find that several sectors need physical proximity to operate: the workers employed in Italy in sectors whose physical proximity index is above the national average are more than 6.5 million (most of them in retail trade). Groups at risk of contagion and complications from COVID-19 (mainly male above the age of 50) work in sectors that are little exposed to physical proximity, currently under lockdown or can work remotely. The sectoral lockdowns put in place by the Italian Government in March 2020 seem to have targeted sectors who operate in physical proximity, but not those directly exposed to infections (the health industry is not subject to lockdown). Most workers who can operate from home have not been put under lockdown and are currently working. Therefore, the number of workers who are not in workplaces could be up to 3 million higher than those whose sector has been shutdown.",OCLC:1183416195,
296,Global Supply Chains in the Pandemic,,Barthélémy Bonadio,"""The authors study the role of global supply chains in the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on GDP growth for 64 countries. They discipline the labor supply shock across sectors and countries using the fraction of work in the sector that can be done from home, interacted with the stringency with which countries imposed lockdown measures. Using the quantitative framework and methods developed in Huo, Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020), they show that the average real GDP downturn due to the Covid-19 shock is expected to be -31.5%, of which -10.7% (or one-third of the total) is due to transmission through global supply chains. However, “renationalization” of global supply chains does not in general make countries more resilient to pandemic-induced contractions in labor supply. The average GDP drop would have been -32.3% in a world without trade in inputs and final goods. This is because eliminating reliance on foreign inputs increases reliance on the domestic inputs, which are also subject to lockdowns. Whether renationalizing supply chains insulates a country from the pandemic depends on whether it plans to impose a more or less stringent lockdown than its trading partners. Finally, unilateral lifting of the lockdowns in the largest economies can contribute as much as 6-8% to GDP growth in some of their smaller trade partners.""--Abstract.",OCLC:1155418281,
303,"Pandemic: Reflections on COVID-19, God's Sovereignty, the Church, & Mission",,Steven R. Martins,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the SARS COVID-2 (COVID-19) virus to be a worldwide pandemic. The news lead to a reaction unlike anything we have seen before, utter pandemonium and governmental lockdown measures that brought most of the world to a stand still. As was expected, the church was not unaffected by the socio-cultural reaction, it too was subject to the lockdowns and later government mandated restrictions. In unprecedented times, members of the church have been asking How do we make sense of COVID-19? Is God still in control of all things? And how can we carry out the Great Commission in a COVID/post-COVID world? Steven R. Martins provides some reflection on these sobering questions.",1777235634,
306,Lockdown Lamentations,A Poem Collection by R.A.N Severin,R a N Severin,"Lockdown Lamentations is a collection of poems by R.A.N Severin, created during the 2020 lockdown in London, UK.These poems reflect a personal journey, characterized and driven by observations, obtained throughout the entirety of the lockdown. Poem by poem the author pivots around a host of emotionally evoked memories, brought forth by the inner or outer implications of the lockdown, whilst also, attempting to make sense of and placing the ever emerging thought processes into a wider context.The main body of the collection centres round the initial March lockdown and also includes the following two lockdowns.The poems often depict a bleak and cheerless canvas, where it appears, the risk of an unfathomable future for humanity itself, is imminent, unless a collective, united mindset is obtained, along with a spiritually combative approach and a willingness to alter the current reality, we find ourselves submerged in.However, there is still a glimmer of hope and a silver lining, in what the author enthusiastically describes, as ""The Real New Order"". This concept, the author suggests, could prove an antidote to the current state of humanity, and deliver the promise of a potentially alternative lockdown outcome, birthed and sustained by love and a non-compliant response to the actual lockdown consequences, such as loss of civil liberties, freedom of speech and democracy.In fact, most of the collection concerns itself with the eroding of democracy as a direct result of the lockdown, while questioning the underlying reasons along with the general state of humanity, as we know or perceive it.There is constant and mercilessly flowing undertone running through the poems, suggesting, time is of essence if, humanity is to be reclaimed and subsequently overhauled, in order to secure a new and enhanced level of human ideals, morals, visions, directions and interactions.Part of the author's lockdown voyage encompasses aspects of race relations arisen from personal experiences, and also by the murder of George Floyd.R.A.N Severin is in no hurry to please with her debut poem collection.She doesn't smooth edges in pursuit of popularity, but rather sticks to her loaded guns, while following her heart.Her delivery is mostly heart-piercing and confrontational, whether the subject matter is race, personal, spiritual or global. Her crunchy take on reality, may be debatable, but never boring and her objective seems to always concern itself with integrity and a steadfast refusal to being taken prisoner or made a victim for her convictions and beliefs.Dive right in and explore R.A.N Severin's debut poem collection with the self imposed risk of yearning to get back on safe, dry ground, or perhaps align with its message, as you embrace your own inner critical thinker.",9798588741378,Lockdown Lamentations A Poem Collection by R.A.N Severin
310,COVID-19 Prevention and Air Pollution in the Absence of a Lockdown,,Hung-Hao Chang,"Recent studies demonstrate that air quality improved during the coronavirus pandemic due to the imposition of social lockdowns. We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on air pollution in the two largest cities in Taiwan, which were not subject to economic or mobility restrictions. Using a generalized difference-in-differences approach and real-time data on air quality and transportation, we estimate that levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter increased 5 - 12 percent relative to 2017 - 2019. We demonstrate that this counterintuitive finding is likely due to a shift in preferences for mode of transport away from public transportation and towards personal automobiles. Similar COVID-19 prevention behaviors in regions or countries emerging from lockdowns could likewise result in an increase in air pollution.",OCLC:1183717893,
