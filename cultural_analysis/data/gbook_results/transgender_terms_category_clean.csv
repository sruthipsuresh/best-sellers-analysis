24,Microaggressions and Philosophy,,Lauren Freeman,"This is the first book to offer a philosophical engagement with microaggressions. It aims to provide an intersectional analysis of microaggressions that cuts across multiple dimensions of oppression and marginalization, and to engage a variety of perspectives that have been sidelined within the discipline of philosophy. The volume gathers a diverse group of contributors: philosophers of color, philosophers with disabilities, philosophers of various nationalities and ethnicities, and philosophers of several gender identities. Their unique frames of analysis articulate both how the concept of microaggressions can be used to clarify and sharpen our understanding of subtler aspects of oppression and how analysis, expansion, and reconceiving the notion of a microaggression can deepen and extend its explanatory power. The essays in the volume seek to defend microaggressions from common critiques and to explain their impact beyond the context of college students. Some of the guiding questions that this volume explores include, but are not limited to, the following: Can microaggressions be established as a viable scientific concept? What roles do microaggressions play in other oppressive phenomena like transphobia, fat phobia, and abelism? How can epistemological challenges around microaggressions be addressed via feminist theory, critical race theory, disability theory, or epistemologies of ignorance? What insights can be gleaned from intersectional analyses of microaggressions? Are there domain-specific analyses of microaggressions that would give insight to features of that domain, i.e. microaggressions related to sexuality, athletics, immigration status, national origin, body type, or ability. Microaggressions and Philosophyfeatures cutting-edge research on an important topic that will appeal to a wide range of students and scholars across disciplines. It includes perspectives from philosophy of psychology, empirically informed philosophy, feminist philosophy, critical race theory, disability theory, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, and social and political philosophy.",0367077418,

The term, originally developed in the 1970s by Chester Peirce to describe the ways in which Black people were ""put down"" by their White counterparts, has since been expanded to describe both conscious and unconscious acts that reflect superiority, hostility, and racially inflicted insults and demeanors to marginalized groups of people. This book provides a platform for social work researchers, scholars, and practitioners to present their research, ideas, and practices pertaining to ways in which microaggressions and other subtle, but lethal forms of discrimination impact marginalized populations within social work and human services. Contributors discuss the impact of microaggressions in social work as they relate to race; gender and gender expression; sexual orientation; class; and spirituality.

30,White Spaces Missing Faces,Why Women of Color Don't Trust White Women,Catrice M. Jackson,"There has NEVER been a time in history when white women have collectively stood up for or put their lives at risk for women of color; ever! Women of color have centuries of legitimate reasons to NOT trust white women; in personal relationships, on the job and online. Racism and White Feminism are paramount to why women of color do NOT attend, participate, thrive or stay in white spaces. White spaces are toxic breeding grounds for racial interpersonal violence under the guise of ""feminism"" and women's empowerment. White Spaces Missing Faces boldly objects the illusion of inclusion and exposes the unrepentant truth about the Weapons of Whiteness used by white women to silence, marginalize, violate and oppress women of color. White Spaces Missing Faces unearths the covert roots of racial antipathy between white women and women of color and provides radical solutions for relationship reconciliation, reparation and restoration. White Spaces Missing Faces teaches you how to lay down your Weapons of Whiteness to stop assaulting women of color while creating, cultivating and sustaining an environment where they stay, thrive and flourish by denouncing your own racism and becoming an anti-racist Accomplice.",0983839832,White Spaces Missing Faces Why Women of Color Don't Trust White Women
32,Is 'Black' Really Beautiful?,Dehumanizing and Intentional Ethics of Descriptions and Vilifying Philosophies of Naming,Kuir √´ Garang,"Is 'Black' Really Beautiful? presents a racially decentered discourse on race, racism and color. It maintains that who people are 'ontically' speaking, and the color that has been used to describe them aren't one and the same. In other words, Blackness in itself isn't Africanness; and Whiteness isn't Europeanness. So how a group of people is racially described should be taken with moral priority because descriptions affect the social consciousness, racial reflexivity, and moral standing of such a group of people in inter-racial and inter-cultural interactions and discourses. So any given racial description should be judged against a moral gauge or meter to ascertain its societal value. So far, how the African Personhood is described fails all the moral requirements of a decent and civil regard. This new ontological discourse is meant to socio-intellectually humble European socio-intellectual hegemony, and make the African Personhood worth positive pedagogy and hermeneutic.",9780991678945,Is 'Black' Really Beautiful?

34,Racial Microaggressions in Academia: Black Students‚Äô Perspective,A Dissertation Presented to the Faculty of Springfield College in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy,Patricia Elisnord,"ABSTRACT: The current study was designed to explore the experiences of Black and or African American identified student‚Äôs experiences with instances of racial microaggressions in academic settings. Black students from a predominantly White institution in the Northeast were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format to explore the following research questions: (a) what is the experience of Black students with racial microaggressions in academic settings? (b) How do Black students navigate instances of racial microaggressions in academic settings? (c) How does the experience of racial microaggressions impact educational motivation and performance? Results included several themes including being perceived as an aggressor or criminal, under or over representation, normalizing, presumptions/stereotyping, despondent, fear of retaliation disconfirmation, and self-doubt. Black students associated their racial microaggressive experience with being Black and having a different racial background then their aggressors. Each theme was broken down and discussed further in this paper. The findings provide insight towards the need to bring awareness to academic institutions and policy makers, encourage the implementation of additional support in academic settings for Black students, as well as information to better inform mental health counselors and psychologists working with this population.",OCLC:1192543495,Racial Microaggressions in Academia: Black Students‚Äô Perspective A Dissertation Presented to the Faculty of Springfield College in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy

39,The Ethics of Microaggression,,Regina Rini,"""Slips of the tongue, unwitting favoritism and stereotyped assumptions are just some examples of microaggression. Nearly all of us commit microaggressions at some point, even if we don't intend to. Yet over time a pattern of microaggression can cause considerable harm by reminding members of marginalized groups of their precarious position. The Ethics of Microaggression is a much needed and clearly written exploration of this pervasive yet complex problem. What is microaggression and how do we know when it is occurring? Can we be held responsible for microaggressions and if so, how? How has social media affected the problem? What role can philosophy play in understanding microaggression? Regina Rini explores these highly topical and controversial questions in an engaging and fair-minded way, arguing that an event is a microaggression precisely because it causes a marginalized person to experience an ambiguous encounter with oppression. She illustrates her argument with compelling examples from media, politics and psychology and explains the significance of essential concepts, such as media representation, reparative renaming, and safe spaces. The Ethics of Microaggression explains what microaggression is and offers strategies for combating it. Assuming no prior knowledge of the topic or philosophy, it demystifies a controversial and extremely important topic in clear language. It is ideal for anyone coming to the topic for the first time and for students in philosophy, gender studies, race theory, disability theory and social and political philosophy""--",1315195054,
41,Subtle Acts of Exclusion,"How to Understand, Identify, and Stop Microaggressions",Tiffany Jana,"The first practical, accessible, nonjudgmental handbook helps individuals and organizations recognize and prevent microaggressions so that all employees can feel the sense of belonging in the workplace that they deserve. Our workplaces are growing more diverse, but are we supporting inclusive cultures? While overt racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination are relatively easy to spot, we cannot neglect the subtler everyday actions that normalize exclusion in our workplaces. Many have heard the term microaggression, but not everyone fully understands what microaggressions are or how to recognize them and stop them from happening. In this book, Tiffany Jana and Michael Baran offer a clearer, more accessible term, subtle acts of exclusion, or SAE, to emphasize the purpose and effect of microaggressions. Whether in the form of exaggerated stereotypes, backhanded compliments, unfounded assumptions, or objectification, SAE are insidious and damaging to our coworkers and colleagues. Jana and Baran give simple and clear tools to identify and address such acts, even offering scripts for helpful ways to approach discussions of difficult, uncomfortable, and deeply personal topics in a professional setting.",1523087056,"Subtle Acts of Exclusion How to Understand, Identify, and Stop Microaggressions"
43,Microaggressions in Ministry,Confronting the Hidden Violence of Everyday Church,Cody J. Sanders,"Carlos--a third-generation U.S. citizen from New Jersey whose family emigrated from Colombia many years before Carlos was born--is often complimented on how articulate he is and asked how long he has been in the United States. Deborah, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) who is up for election as church treasurer, has her qualifications questioned, debated, and scrutinized by the congregation far more than any of her male predecessors who were elected with a simple vote. Lisa, a male-to-female transgender person, attends a Sunday school where her classmates continue to refer to her with masculine pronouns (he, him, his). The three examples above portray microaggressions: subtle slights, insults, and indignities expressed to persons of varied minority statuses. Although microaggressions are usually unintentional, they occur on a regular basis in education, the workplace, and daily life. This is the first book that addresses the concept of microaggressions in ministry and church life. Drawing from their background as ordained clergy, Sanders and Yarber introduce ministry leaders to the concept of microaggressions and look specifically at microaggressions directed at race, gender, and sexuality in the church. Sanders and Yarber help readers become more aware of these subtle and often unconscious communications, offering realistic examples and guidance for grappling with this issue in preaching, religious education, worship, spirituality, and pastoral care and counseling. Microaggressions in Ministry equips congregations with methods for assessment and tools for action that will ultimately help create stronger, more welcoming faith communities.",9780664260576,Microaggressions in Ministry Confronting the Hidden Violence of Everyday Church
45,Global Perspectives on Microaggressions in Schools,Understanding and Combating Covert Violence,Taylor & Francis Group,"Recognizing microaggression as an often unseen, yet pervasive issue in schools globally, this book offers critical examination of instances of aggression, hostility, and incivility in school contexts around the world. Drawing on authors' experiences and empirical analyses, the volume puts forward practical recommendations to remedy such violence and tackle its root causes. Global Perspectives on Microaggressions in Schools brings together contributions from South Africa, Australia, Canada, and the US to explore the various forms that microaggression can take. Authors implement qualitative methodologies, personal reflection, and empirical literature to document microaggressions perpetrated by, and directed against all members of the school community, including students, teachers, school leaders and administrators. In doing so, they highlight ongoing issues including xenophobia, sexual violence, and prejudice against gifted students, LGBTQ, refugee, and indigenous communities. Looking forward, the volume proposes practical ways to undermine such prejudices and prevent the occurrence of microaggressions through effective training, policy, leadership, and student agency. Given its rigorous approach and attention to widespread issues of school violence, this book will be a timely resource for scholars, researchers, and academics with an interest in the sociology of education, educational leadership, school culture, student well-being, and inclusive education. In addition, school leaders, administrators, pre- and in-service educators may find benefit from reading this volume.",036754556X,Global Perspectives on Microaggressions in Schools Understanding and Combating Covert Violence

Latinx students disproportionally begin their higher education journey at community colleges. Of the Latinx students who do transfer, a limited number of students transfer to Research 1: Doctoral Universities. Once at the receiving 4-year institution, transfer students are oftentimes perceived as less academically prepared. By experiencing racial microaggressions, Latinx transfer students may discern messages as not feeling capable enough to succeed. Guided by Critical Race Theory and Sol√≥rzano‚Äôs model for understanding racial microaggressions, this qualitative study explored how seven Latinx undergraduate transfer students have been impacted by systemic racism, specifically racial microaggressions, at a public R1 university. The purpose of the study was to document and gain a deeper understanding of the racialized experiences of Latinx transfer students at R1 institutions. Four themes emerged from the findings: experiences with campus climate, transfer experiences, academic experiences, and empowerment through community. Findings provide insight into the type of racial microaggressions Latinx students experience, how they respond to these incidents, and the effects of racial microaggressions as participants navigate a 4-year institution as transfer students. Recommendations for policy and practice include increased diversification of staff and faculty, institutional transparency, dissemination of information, additional support for current resources, increased conversations about race and intersectionality, and development of spaces for Latinx transfer students. Lastly, recommendations for future research are also included.",9798698591221,Strength in Comunidad Experiences of Latinx Transfer Students with Racial Microaggressions at R1 Universities

Data collection was conducted through demographic questionnaire, retention questionnaire, and use of the Racial Microaggressions Scale (RMAS) (Torres-Harding et al., 2012). There was a statistically significant relationship between the subscale of Foreigner/Not Belonging and African American's thoughts on dropping out during the ongoing semester [r(51)=.338, p",OCLC:1010501384,You PC Bro?

63,The Role of Perceived Social Support in Understanding the Effects of Racial Microaggressions on Barriers and Stress for African American College Students,,Brittany Sievers,"The purpose of this study was to test the effects of racial microaggressions on minority status stress and perceived academic and career barriers, as moderated by social support among African American college students. It was hypothesized that social support would significantly moderate the effect of microaggressions on perceived academic and career barriers and minority status stress, such that higher levels of social support would be related to lower levels of perceived barriers and minority student stress. Participants were recruited from a mid-size Midwestern university from Introductory Psychology 102 courses, university-based student organizations, and the Africana Studies Department. Experiences with microaggressions were assessed using Nadal's Racial and Ethnic Microaggression Scale (REMS; Nadal, 2011), perception of academic and career barriers were measured using the Perception of Barriers Scale (POBS; Luzzo & McWhirter, 2001), social support was measured using the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL; Cohen & Hoberman, 1983), and minority status stress was measured using the Minority Student Stress Scale (MSS; Smedley, Myers, & Harrell, 1993). A demographics questionnaire was administered as well. A moderated multiple-regression analysis was conducted to test the study hypotheses. Our study hypotheses that perceived social support would moderate the relationship between microaggressions and minority status stress and perceptions of barriers was not supported. However, main effects were found for microaggressions and social support on minority status stress, as well as main effects for social support on perceptions of barriers. Future research and implications are discussed.",OCLC:1037352895,
64,Coping with Racial Microaggressions,An Exploration of Latina/o College Students Attending a Hispanic Serving Institution,Rebecca Gonzalez,"The negative ramifications of racial microaggressions are a burgeoning area of empirical inquiry; however, there is a paucity of research that examines how Latinas/os experience and cope with racial microaggresions. Thus, this qualitative study explored the emotional consequences of exposure to racial microaggressions and coping skills utilized to combat these discriminatory experiences. Seventeen participants who were attending a Hispanic Serving Institution in the Southwest were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. A constructivism grounded theory approach informed the conceptualization, execution and analysis of this study. Emerging themes based on participant responses included: Societal and Cultural Factors that Influence Discrimination Against Latina/os, Perception of Campus Racial Climate, Experience of Racial Microaggressions, Appraisal of Microaggressions, Emotional Reactions to Racial Microaggressions, Coping with Racial Microaggressions, and Recommendations for Creating a Safer Racial Climate for Latina/os. A theory was proposed that explained how Latina/o students cope with racial discrimination/racial microaggressions at a Hispanic Serving Institution. The results are discussed using a Critical Race Theory lens. Implications and future directions are presented.",OCLC:957239243,Coping with Racial Microaggressions An Exploration of Latina/o College Students Attending a Hispanic Serving Institution
65,Racial Microaggressions and Its Impact on Supervisees of Color in Cross-racial Counseling Supervision,,Niyatee Sukumaran,"Supervision is considered to be a primary method of clinical instruction (Holloway, 1992), which serves as a foundation to train supervisees and to ensure the provision of appropriate and culturally sensitive client care. While the representation of supervisees of color in the field of psychology is continuing to increase, it appears important to recognize multicultural issues (e.g., racial microaggressions) as it exists and/or emerges in cross-racial supervision. Although less is known about how racial microaggressions influence supervisees of color, the purpose of this study was to investigate how experiences of racial microaggressions affects the supervisory working alliance, their perceptions of their supervisors‚Äô multicultural competence, and supervisee outcome variables (i.e., counseling and multicultural counseling self-efficacy) in cross-racial supervision. The results showed that perceived supervisor multicultural competence partially mediated the relationship between racial microaggressions and supervisory working alliance. Both, supervisory working alliance and perceived supervisor multicultural competence fully mediated the relationship between racial microaggressions and multicultural counseling self-efficacy. However, no support for the mediation was found in this sample for counseling self-efficacy. Limitation, implications and future directions are discussed.",OCLC:957157625,

67,Black Female Graduate Students' Experiences of Racial Microaggressions at a Southern University,,Kendra Elizabeth Shoge,"Researchers have found that microaggressions can cause psychological distress, frustration, avoidance, confusion, resentment, hopelessness, and fear. Previous studies from Southern universities have addressed the adjustment experiences of Black women in graduate programs, obstacles faced by Black women in higher education and strategies to overcome those obstacles, and factors associated with Black student motivation and achievement. Discrimination and racism are factors identified in those studies, however, there is little research on the experiences of Black women in graduate programs and the impact of racial microaggressions on them. The purpose of this study was to examine Black female graduate students' experiences of racial microaggressions at a Southern university. Five women participated in the study, and a phenomenological research design was used to identify individual and group themes. These themes revealed the impact of racial microaggressions on the participants, as well as the campus climate. Findings suggest training opportunities and mentor programs that would improve experiences for Black female graduate students on campus.",OCLC:1140906249,

Existing research on trauma and resilience and the theological frameworks that undergirded the project are presented. Additionally, hate crime statistics and a brief history of hate crime legislation are discussed to illustrate patterns and trends and to expose knowledge gaps caused by unreported and underreported hate crimes (Anti-Defamation League, 2018a, p. 1). Furthermore, this project illuminates the impact of non-criminal micro and macroaggressions--either intentional or non-intentional--on individuals who do not belong to the local or global dominant groups. Through a process of semi-structured interviews, eleven diverse women--representing the three Abrahamic faiths--were invited to share about the best and hardest aspects of living in King County, WA; their relationship with God; how they respond to harm and adversity; how their faith informs their response; and symbols that for them mean all will be okay""--Abstract.",OCLC:1176567263,

74,So We Beat on,How Native Interpreters at Living History Museums Experience Racial Microaggressions,Sierra Ann Young,"For a long and painful time, dominant society has chosen how and for what purposes Indigenous history and identity is portrayed to the general public. From the racist ethnographic displays of yesteryear to the often problematic living history museums of today, Native American interpreters have had to cope with the fundamental disconnect between the reality of contemporary Native American culture and non-Native individuals‚Äô expectations of it. The purpose of this study is to understand the extent to, and ways in which, Native American interpreters at living history museums experience and deal with instances of racism while interpreting their Native history. This study was guided by Indigenous research methodologies, and includes interviews with six Native American interpreters working at sites across the United States. Using Derald Wing Sue's racial microaggression framework, this study found that all of the interpreters experienced racial microaggressions, and that they have found ways of mitigating the effects of their negative experiences. Living history museums can consider some of these mitigation techniques in order to encourage and maintain Native participation at their sites.",OCLC:954057339,So We Beat on How Native Interpreters at Living History Museums Experience Racial Microaggressions
75,The Power of Language,How the Words We Use Reflect Our Biases,Otter Lynn Day,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between language use and attitudes related to sexual orientation. Significant research has demonstrated that the use of microaggressions (slurs, snubs, or insults used to communicate hostility) towards targeted minorities carries detrimental consequences on a societal and individual level. While racially charged and gendered microaggressions have been investigated, a gap exists regarding sexual orientation microaggressions; more specifically, the word ‚ÄúQueer‚Äù. Participants were asked to answer questions related to the use of ‚ÄúQueer‚Äù along with several measures of related constructs. Results indicate differences between homosexuals and heterosexuals in the use of ‚ÄúQueer‚Äù in terms of dynamic language, honesty, frequency and power. Explicit attitudes, religious fundamentalism, social dominance orientation, and conservatism emerged as predictors of the use of ‚ÄúQueer‚Äù. Findings provide insightful evidence to how language is used to perpetuate social norms related to sexual orientation that can be applied in a variety of settings to foster safer environments for the targeted group.",OCLC:1137549079,The Power of Language How the Words We Use Reflect Our Biases

77,Individual's Self Awareness of Mental Illness,"The Effects on Implicit Bias, Microaggressions, and Racial Discrimination",Sarah M. Zoubaa,"The purpose of the current study is to understand the factors that impact how persons experiencing subclinical psychological symptoms or an undiagnosed but clinically significant psychological problem perceive individuals who [have] been diagnosed with mental illness. Previous literature has investigated the experiences of discrimination among those with mental health problems, but not their attitudes and behavior towards individuals among their in-group. It was hypothesized that individuals with an emerging mental health problem will have higher rates of implicit bias and perpetrate more microaggressions towards those with a mental illness in order to remove themselves from a group that is associated with a great deal of public stigma. Researchers also investigated self-awareness of a mental health problem arising and experiences of racial discrimination as mediators of the relationship. Results indicated that individuals with an emerging mental illness perceived public stigma to be greater than those individuals with no emerging mental illness, but did not have more self-stigma, implicit bias, or perpetrate more microaggressions. Self-awareness moderated the relationship between an emerging mental illness and the perception of public stigma. Individuals with an emerging mental illness reported experiencing more racial microaggressions and discrimination than those individuals without an emerging mental illness.",1392073251,"Individual's Self Awareness of Mental Illness The Effects on Implicit Bias, Microaggressions, and Racial Discrimination"

Donaldson,"Racial microaggression was identified by researchers as the new form of racism, or the modern racism (Meeks, 2010). Racial microaggressions are the subtle and covert measures of racism (Sue, 2010a). The purpose of this study was to explore African American male students' experiences and coping strategies of racial microaggression in secondary schools in Texas. The study addressed the following research questions: 1) How do African American male students in Grades 6-12 experience racial microaggression in their school environment? 2) What coping strategies do African American male students use to deal with racial microaggression experienced at school? The researcher utilized a qualitative research design with a phenomenological approach. Data was collected from participants through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with students in Grades 6-12. Codification of emergent themes found in the data was conducted using the MAXQDA software program. The results and implications of this study will add to the body of knowledge regarding African American male students‚Äô experiences and coping strategies of racial microaggression in secondary schools.
