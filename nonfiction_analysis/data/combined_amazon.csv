Koonin","BenBella Books","2021-05-04","“Surging sea levels are inundating the coasts.” “Hurricanes and tornadoes are becoming fiercer and more frequent.” “Climate change will be an economic disaster.” You’ve heard all this presented as fact. But according to science, all of these statements are profoundly misleading. When it comes to climate change, the media, politicians, and other prominent voices have declared that “the science is settled.” In reality, the long game of telephone from research to reports to the popular media is corrupted by misunderstanding and misinformation. Core questions—about the way the climate is responding to our influence, and what the impacts will be—remain largely unanswered. The climate is changing, but the why and how aren’t as clear as you’ve probably been led to believe. Now, one of America’s most distinguished scientists is clearing away the fog to explain what science really says (and doesn’t say) about our changing climate. In Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why It Matters, Steven Koonin draws upon his decades of experience—including as a top science advisor to the Obama administration—to provide up-to-date insights and expert perspective free from political agendas. Fascinating, clear-headed, and full of surprises, this book gives readers the tools to both understand the climate issue and be savvier consumers of science media in general. Koonin takes readers behind the headlines to the more nuanced science itself, showing us where it comes from and guiding us through the implications of the evidence. He dispels popular myths and unveils little-known truths: despite a dramatic rise in greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures actually decreased from 1940 to 1970. What’s more, the models we use to predict the future aren’t able to accurately describe the climate of the past, suggesting they are deeply flawed. Koonin also tackles society’s response to a changing climate, using data-driven analysis to explain why many proposed “solutions” would be ineffective, and discussing how alternatives like adaptation and, if necessary, geoengineering will ensure humanity continues to prosper. Unsettled is a reality check buoyed by hope, offering the truth about climate science that you aren’t getting elsewhere—what we know, what we don’t, and what it all means for our future.","ISBN_13","9781953295248","True","False","BOOK","Science","5","1","NOT_MATURE","True","0.4.4.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uVMAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uVMAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=uVMAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Unsettled:+What+Climate+Science+Tells+Us,+What+It+Doesn%E2%80%99t,+and+Why+It+Matters+inauthor:Steven+E.+Koonin&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=uVMAEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:Unsettled:+What+Climate+Science+Tells+Us,+What+It+Doesn%E2%80%99t,+and+Why+It+Matters+inauthor:Steven+E.+Koonin&hl=&source=gbs_api","https://books.google.com/books/about/Unsettled.html?hl=&id=uVMAEAAAQBAJ","US","NOT_FOR_SALE","False","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/Unsettled-sample-epub.acsm?id=uVMAEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uVMAEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","Fascinating, clear-headed, and full of surprises, this book gives readers the tools to both understand the climate issue and be savvier consumers of science media in general.","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Photo Gallery included (Medium). A #1 Bestseller in Cults & Demonism and Parenting & Relationships When Misty Griffin was six years old, her family started to live and dress like the Amish. Misty and her sister were kept as slaves on a mountain ranch and subjected to almost complete isolation, sexual abuse, and extreme physical violence. Their stepfather kept a loaded rifle by the door to make sure the young girls were too terrified to try to escape. No rescue would ever come since the few people who knew they existed did not care. When Misty reached her teens, her parents feared she and her sister would escape and took them to an Amish community. Devastated to again find herself in a world of fear, cruelty, and abuse, Misty was sexually assaulted by the bishop. After she escaped and reported the bishop, she found herself alone in a modern world with only a second-grade education and no ID or social security card. Misty has a message for abuse survivors: “Please be encouraged, the cycle of abuse can be broken. This is my story of survival and moving past the abuse to embrace my dreams.” In June 2019 Misty graduated nursing school. She continues to work to raise awareness about child abuse and sexual assault. “A testament to the courage, fortitude and power of one young woman to take back her life.” —Becca Anderson, author of The Book of Awesome Women","ISBN_13","9781633539327","True","True","BOOK","True Crime","4","6","NOT_MATURE","True","preview-1.0.0","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NJYREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NJYREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=NJYREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Tears+of+the+Silenced:+An+Amish+True+Crime+Memoir+of+Childhood+Sexual+Abuse,+Brutal+Betrayal,+and+Ultimate+Survival+inauthor:Misty+Griffin&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NJYREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NJYREAAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/Tears_of_the_Silenced-sample-epub.acsm?id=NJYREAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","True","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NJYREAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","Misty has a message for abuse survivors: “Please be encouraged, the cycle of abuse can be broken.

When Jennifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a paperback titled The Double Helix on her bed. She put it aside, thinking it was one of those detective tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Saturday, she discovered she was right, in a way. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn’t become scientists, she decided she would. Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book’s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned ​a curiosity ​of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions. The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code. Should we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing depression? Hmmm…Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids? After helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in 2020. Her story is a thrilling detective tale that involves the most profound wonders of nature, from the origins of life to the future of our species.","ISBN_13","9781982115876","True","False","BOOK","Biography & Autobiography","5","1","NOT_MATURE","True","2.4.4.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=intitle:The+Code+Breaker:+Jennifer+Doudna,+Gene+Editing,+and+the+Future+of+the+Human+Race+inauthor:Walter+Isaacson&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Code_Breaker-sample-epub.acsm?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","The bestselling author of Leonardo da Vinci and Steve Jobs returns with a gripping account of how Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna and her colleagues launched a revolution that will allow us to cure diseases, fend off viruses, and have ...","560","16.99","USD","16.99","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-f_D3DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","16990000","USD","16990000","USD","True","",""

In The Art of Gathering, Priya Parker argues that the gatherings in our lives are lackluster and unproductive--which they don't have to be. We rely too much on routine and the conventions of gatherings when we should focus on distinctiveness and the people involved. At a time when coming together is more important than ever, Parker sets forth a human-centered approach to gathering that will help everyone create meaningful, memorable experiences, large and small, for work and for play. Drawing on her expertise as a facilitator of high-powered gatherings around the world, Parker takes us inside events of all kinds to show what works, what doesn't, and why. She investigates a wide array of gatherings--conferences, meetings, a courtroom, a flash-mob party, an Arab-Israeli summer camp--and explains how simple, specific changes can invigorate any group experience. The result is a book that's both journey and guide, full of exciting ideas with real-world applications. The Art of Gathering will forever alter the way you look at your next meeting, industry conference, dinner party, and backyard barbecue--and how you host and attend them.","ISBN_13","9781594634932","False","False","BOOK","Business & Economics","5","1","NOT_MATURE","False","preview-1.0.0","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t1LXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t1LXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=t1LXDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=intitle:The+Art+of+Gathering:+How+We+Meet+and+Why+It+Matters+inauthor:Priya+Parker&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=t1LXDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:The+Art+of+Gathering:+How+We+Meet+and+Why+It+Matters+inauthor:Priya+Parker&hl=&source=gbs_api","https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Art_of_Gathering.html?hl=&id=t1LXDwAAQBAJ","US","NOT_FOR_SALE","False","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","False","","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t1LXDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","&quot;Hosts of all kinds, this is a must-read!","320","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is up to you. Eddie Jaku always considered himself a German first, a Jew second. He was proud of his country. But all of that changed on 9 November 1938, when he was beaten, arrested and taken to a concentration camp. Over the next seven years, Eddie faced unimaginable horrors every day, first in Buchenwald, then in Auschwitz, then on the Nazi death march. He lost family, friends, his country. Because he survived, Eddie made the vow to smile every day. He pays tribute to those who were lost by telling his story, sharing his wisdom and living his best possible life. He now believes he is the 'happiest man on earth'. Published as Eddie turns 100, this is a powerful, heartbreaking and ultimately hopeful memoir of how happiness can be found even in the darkest of times.

Jason Schreier's groundbreaking reporting has earned him a place among the preeminent investigative journalists covering the world of video games. In his eagerly anticipated, deeply researched new book, Schreier trains his investigative eye on the volatility of the video game industry and the resilience of the people who work in it. The business of videogames is both a prestige industry and an opaque one. Based on dozens of first-hand interviews that cover the development of landmark games -- Bioshock Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more -- on to the shocking closures of the studios that made them, PRESS RESET tells the stories of how real people are affected by game studio shutdowns, and how they recover, move on, or escape the industry entirely. Schreier's insider interviews cover hostile takeovers, abusive bosses, corporate drama, bounced checks, and that one time the Boston Red Sox's Curt Schilling decided he was going to lead a game studio that would take out World of Warcraft. Along the way, he asks pressing questions about why, when the video game industry is more successful than ever, it's become so hard to make a stable living making video games -- and whether the business of making games can change before it's too late.","ISBN_10","1538735490","False","False","BOOK","Games & Activities","","","NOT_MATURE","False","preview-1.0.0","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=65XXzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=65XXzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=65XXzQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:Press+Reset:+Ruin+and+Recovery+in+the+Video+Game+Industry+inauthor:Jason+Schreier&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=65XXzQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:Press+Reset:+Ruin+and+Recovery+in+the+Video+Game+Industry+inauthor:Jason+Schreier&hl=&source=gbs_api","https://books.google.com/books/about/Press_Reset.html?hl=&id=65XXzQEACAAJ","US","NOT_FOR_SALE","False","US","NO_PAGES","False","False","ALLOWED","False","","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=65XXzQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","NONE","False","Based on dozens of firsthand interviews and covering the development of landmark games including Bioshock: Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more, and through the studios&#39; shocking closures, this book will tell the stories of how real ...","304","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In November of 1954 a young woman dressed plainly in a white oxford, dark sunglasses and a black pageboy wig boards a midnight flight from Los Angeles to New York. As the plane’s engines rev she breathes a sigh of relief, lights a cigarette and slips off her wig revealing a tangle of fluffy blonde curls. Marilyn Monroe was leaving Hollywood behind, and along with it a failed marriage and a frustrating career. She needed a break from the scrutiny and insanity of LA. She needed Manhattan. In Manhattan, the most famous woman in the world can wander the streets unbothered, spend hours at the Met getting lost in art, and afternoons buried in the stacks of the Strand. Marilyn begins to live a life of the mind in New York; she dates Arthur Miller, dances with Truman Capote and drinks with Carson McCullers.

In 1994, a team led by fossil-hunting legend Tim White—”the Steve Jobs of paleoanthropology”—uncovered the bones of a human ancestor in Ethiopia’s Afar region. Radiometric dating of nearby rocks indicated the skeleton, classified as Ardipithecus ramidus, was 4.4 million years old, more than a million years older than “Lucy,” then the oldest known human ancestor. The findings challenged many assumptions about human evolution—how we started walking upright, how we evolved our nimble hands, and, most significantly, whether we were descended from an ancestor that resembled today’s chimpanzee—and repudiated a half-century of paleoanthropological orthodoxy. Fossil Men is the first full-length exploration of Ardi, the fossil men who found her, and her impact on what we know about the origins of the human species. It is a scientific detective story played out in anatomy and the natural history of the human body. Kermit Pattison brings into focus a cast of eccentric, obsessive scientists, including one of the world’s greatest fossil hunters, Tim White—an exacting and unforgiving fossil hunter whose virtuoso skills in the field were matched only by his propensity for making enemies; Gen Suwa, a Japanese savant who sometimes didn’t bother going home at night to devote more hours to science; Owen Lovejoy, a onetime creationist-turned-paleoanthropologist; Berhane Asfaw, who survived imprisonment and torture to become Ethiopia’s most senior paleoanthropologist and who fought for African scientists to gain equal footing in the study of human origins; and the Leakeys, for decades the most famous family in paleoanthropology. An intriguing tale of scientific discovery, obsession and rivalry that moves from the sun-baked desert of Africa and a nation caught in a brutal civil war, to modern high-tech labs and academic lecture halls, Fossil Men is popular science at its best, and a must read for fans of Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins, and Edward O. Wilson.","ISBN_13","9780062410306","True","False","BOOK","Science","4.5","2","NOT_MATURE","True","1.1.1.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=506oDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=506oDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=506oDAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=intitle:Fossil+Men:+The+Quest+for+the+Oldest+Skeleton+and+the+Origins+of+Humankind+inauthor:Kermit+Pattison&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=506oDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=506oDAAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/Fossil_Men-sample-epub.acsm?id=506oDAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=506oDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","In Fossil Men, acclaimed journalist Kermit Pattison brings us a cast of eccentric, obsessive scientists, including White, an uncompromising perfectionist whose virtuoso skills in the field were matched only by his propensity for making ...","544","14.99","USD","14.99","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=506oDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-506oDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","14990000","USD","14990000","USD","True","",""

Since then, Amazon has expanded exponentially, inventing novel products like Alexa and disrupting countless industries, while its workforce has quintupled in size and its valuation has soared to well over a trillion dollars. Jeff Bezos’s empire, once housed in a garage, now spans the globe. Between services like Whole Foods, Prime Video, and Amazon’s cloud computing unit, AWS, plus Bezos’s ownership of The Washington Post, it’s impossible to go a day without encountering its impact. We live in a world run, supplied, and controlled by Amazon and its iconoclast founder. In Amazon Unbound, Brad Stone presents a deeply reported, vividly drawn portrait of how a retail upstart became one of the most powerful and feared entities in the global economy. Stone also probes the evolution of Bezos himself—who started as a geeky technologist totally devoted to building Amazon, but who transformed to become a fit, disciplined billionaire with global ambitions; who ruled Amazon with an iron fist, even as he found his personal life splashed over the tabloids. Definitive, timely, and revelatory, Stone has provided an unvarnished portrait of a man and company that we couldn’t imagine modern life without.","ISBN_13","9781982132637","True","False","BOOK","Business & Economics","","","NOT_MATURE","False","1.1.1.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DBgVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DBgVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=DBgVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=intitle:Amazon+Unbound:+Jeff+Bezos+and+the+Invention+of+a+Global+Empire+inauthor:Brad+Stone&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DBgVEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DBgVEAAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/Amazon_Unbound-sample-epub.acsm?id=DBgVEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DBgVEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","In Amazon Unbound, Brad Stone presents a deeply reported, vividly drawn portrait of how a retail upstart became one of the most powerful and feared entities in the global economy.","496","14.99","USD","14.99","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DBgVEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DBgVEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","14990000","USD","14990000","USD","True","",""

And you can have it too.

Most people know Andrew McCarthy from his movie roles in Pretty in Pink, St. Elmo's Fire, Weekend at Bernie's, and Less than Zero, and as a charter member of Hollywood's Brat Pack. That iconic group of ingenues and heartthrobs included Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, and Demi Moore, and has come to represent both a genre of film and an era of pop culture. In his memoir Brat: An '80s Story, McCarthy focuses his gaze on that singular moment in time. The result is a revealing look at coming of age in a maelstrom, reckoning with conflicted ambition, innocence, addiction, and masculinity. New York City of the 1980s is brought to vivid life in these pages, from scoring loose joints in Washington Square Park to skipping school in favor of the dark revival houses of the Village where he fell in love with the movies that would change his life. Filled with personal revelations of innocence lost to heady days in Hollywood with John Hughes and an iconic cast of characters, Brat is a surprising and intimate story of an outsider caught up in a most unwitting success.","ISBN_13","9781538754283","True","False","BOOK","Biography & Autobiography","5","1","NOT_MATURE","False","1.1.1.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Oz7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Oz7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=7Oz7DwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:Brat:+An+%2780s+Story+inauthor:Andrew+McCarthy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=7Oz7DwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:Brat:+An+%2780s+Story+inauthor:Andrew+McCarthy&hl=&source=gbs_api","https://books.google.com/books/about/Brat.html?hl=&id=7Oz7DwAAQBAJ","US","NOT_FOR_SALE","False","US","NO_PAGES","False","False","ALLOWED","True","","True","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7Oz7DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","NONE","False","Most people know Andrew McCarthy from his movie roles in Pretty in Pink, St. Elmo&#39;s Fire, Weekend at Bernie&#39;s, and Less than Zero, and as a charter member of Hollywood&#39;s Brat Pack.","224","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Norton & Company","2021-05-04","For those who could read between the lines, the censored news out of China was terrifying. But the president insisted there was nothing to worry about. Fortunately, we are still a nation of skeptics. Fortunately, there are those among us who study pandemics and are willing to look unflinchingly at worst-case scenarios. Michael Lewis’s taut and brilliant nonfiction thriller pits a band of medical visionaries against the wall of ignorance that was the official response of the Trump administration to the outbreak of COVID-19. The characters you will meet in these pages are as fascinating as they are unexpected. A thirteen-year-old girl’s science project on transmission of an airborne pathogen develops into a very grown-up model of disease control. A local public-health officer uses her worm’s-eye view to see what the CDC misses, and reveals great truths about American society. A secret team of dissenting doctors, nicknamed the Wolverines, has everything necessary to fight the pandemic: brilliant backgrounds, world-class labs, prior experience with the pandemic scares of bird flu and swine flu…everything, that is, except official permission to implement their work. Michael Lewis is not shy about calling these people heroes for their refusal to follow directives that they know to be based on misinformation and bad science. Even the internet, as crucial as it is to their exchange of ideas, poses a risk to them. They never know for sure who else might be listening in.","ISBN_13","9780393881561","True","False","BOOK","Political Science","","","NOT_MATURE","True","1.1.1.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t8kWEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t8kWEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=t8kWEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:The+Premonition:+A+Pandemic+Story+inauthor:Michael+Lewis&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t8kWEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t8kWEAAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Premonition_A_Pandemic_Story-sample-epub.acsm?id=t8kWEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t8kWEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","Michael Lewis is not shy about calling these people heroes for their refusal to follow directives that they know to be based on misinformation and bad science.","320","26.23","USD","9.18","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t8kWEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-t8kWEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","26230000","USD","9180000","USD","True","",""

If you always assumed the musicians you listened to were the same people you saw onstage, you are in for a big surprise!""-Dusty Street, host of Classic Vinyl on Sirius XM Satellite Radio If you were a fan of popular music in the 1960s and early '70s, you were a fan of the Wrecking Crew-whether you knew it or not. On hit record after hit record by everyone from the Byrds, the Beach Boys, and the Monkees to the Grass Roots, the 5th Dimension, Sonny & Cher, and Simon & Garfunkel, this collection of West Coast studio musicians from diverse backgrounds established themselves in Los Angeles, California as the driving sound of pop music-sometimes over the objection of actual band members forced to make way for Wrecking Crew members. Industry insider Kent Hartman tells the dramatic, definitive story of the musicians who forged a reputation throughout the business as the secret weapons behind the top recording stars. Mining invaluable interviews, the author follows the careers of such session masters as drummer Hal Blaine and keyboardist Larry Knechtel, as well as trailblazing bassist Carol Kaye-the only female in the bunch-who went on to play in thousands of recording sessions in this rock history. Readers will discover the Wrecking Crew members who would forge careers in their own right, including Glen Campbell and Leon Russell, and learn of the relationship between the Crew and such legends as Phil Spector and Jimmy Webb. Hartman also takes us inside the studio for the legendary sessions that gave us Pet Sounds, Bridge Over Troubled Water, and the rock classic ""Layla,"" which Wrecking Crew drummer Jim Gordon cowrote with Eric Clapton for Derek and the Dominos. And the author recounts priceless scenes such as Mike Nesmith of the Monkees facing off with studio head Don Kirshner, Grass Roots lead guitarist (and future star of The Office) Creed Bratton getting fired from the group, and Michel Rubini unseating Frank Sinatra's pianist for the session in which the iconic singer improvised the hit-making ending to ""Strangers in the Night.""

It was a devastating triple punch. Capping their four-year campaign to destroy the Trump presidency, the media portrayed a Democratic victory as necessary and inevitable. Big Tech, wielding unprecedented powers, vaporized dissent and erased damning reports about the Biden family's corruption. And Democratic operatives, exploiting a public health crisis, shamelessly manipulated the voting process itself. Silenced and subjected, the American people lost their faith in the system. RIGGED is the definitive account of the 2020 election. Based on Mollie Hemingway's exclusive interviews with campaign officials, reporters, Supreme Court justices, and President Trump himself, it exposes the fraud and cynicism behind the Democrats' historic power-grab. Rewriting history is a specialty of the radical left, now in control of America's political and cultural heights. But they will have to contend with the determination, insight, and eloquence of Mollie Hemingway. RIGGED is a reminder for weary patriots that truth is still the most powerful weapon. The stakes for our democracy have never been higher.","ISBN_13","9781684512638","True","False","BOOK","Political Science","","","NOT_MATURE","False","preview-1.0.0","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9G0sEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9G0sEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=9G0sEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:Rigged:+How+the+Media,+Big+Tech,+and+the+Democrats+Seized+Our+Elections+inauthor:Mollie+Hemingway&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=9G0sEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:Rigged:+How+the+Media,+Big+Tech,+and+the+Democrats+Seized+Our+Elections+inauthor:Mollie+Hemingway&hl=&source=gbs_api","https://books.google.com/books/about/Rigged.html?hl=&id=9G0sEAAAQBAJ","US","NOT_FOR_SALE","False","US","NO_PAGES","False","False","ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","False","","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9G0sEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","NONE","False","But they will have to contend with the determination, insight, and eloquence of Mollie Hemingway.

It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very lives.” —Oprah Winfrey This book is going to change the way you see your life. Have you ever wondered ""Why did I do that?"" or ""Why can't I just control my behavior?"" Others may judge our reactions and think, ""What's wrong with that person?"" When questioning our emotions, it's easy to place the blame on ourselves; holding ourselves and those around us to an impossible standard. It's time we started asking a different question. Through deeply personal conversations, Oprah Winfrey and renowned brain and trauma expert Dr. Bruce Perry offer a groundbreaking and profound shift from asking “What’s wrong with you?” to “What happened to you?” Our earliest experiences shape our lives far down the road, and What Happened to You? provides powerful scientific and emotional insights into the behavioral patterns so many of us struggle to understand. Here, Winfrey shares stories from her own past, understanding through experience the vulnerability that comes from facing trauma and adversity at a young age. Joining forces with Dr. Perry, one of the world’s leading experts on childhood and brain development, Winfrey and Dr. Perry marry the power of storytelling with science to better understand and overcome the effects of our pasts. In conversation throughout the book, the two focus on understanding people, behavior, and ourselves. It’s a subtle but profound shift in our approach to trauma, and it’s one that allows us to understand our pasts in order to clear a path to our future—opening the door to resilience and healing in a proven, powerful way.","ISBN_13","9781250223210","True","False","BOOK","Psychology","","","NOT_MATURE","True","1.2.2.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:What+Happened+to+You%3F:+Conversations+on+Trauma,+Resilience,+and+Healing+inauthor:Oprah+Winfrey&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/What_Happened_to_You-sample-epub.acsm?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very lives.”—Oprah Winfrey This book is going to change the way you see your life.

Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists, the “Bomber Mafia,” asked: What if precision bombing could cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? In contrast, the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared even more by averting a planned US invasion. In The Bomber Mafia, Gladwell asks, “Was it worth it?” Things might have gone differently had LeMay’s predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge. Hansell believed in precision bombing, but when he and Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam, LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II. The Bomber Mafia is a riveting tale of persistence, innovation, and the incalculable wages of war.","ISBN_13","9780316296939","True","False","BOOK","History","4","2","NOT_MATURE","True","1.2.2.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_gQXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_gQXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=_gQXEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=intitle:The+Bomber+Mafia:+A+Dream,+a+Temptation,+and+the+Longest+Night+of+the+Second+World+War+inauthor:Malcolm+Gladwell&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_gQXEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_gQXEAAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Bomber_Mafia-sample-epub.acsm?id=_gQXEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_gQXEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","A <b>Dream, a Temptation, and the Longest Night of the Second World War</b> Malcolm <br>\n<b>Gladwell</b>.

Laura was in her early twenties and directionless when she quit her job to backpack in Bolivia. Fate landed her at a wildlife sanctuary on the edge of the Amazon jungle where she was assigned to a beautiful and complex puma named Wayra. Wide-eyed, inexperienced, and comically terrified, Laura made the scrappy, make-do camp her home. And in Wayra, she made a friend for life. They weren't alone, not with over a hundred quirky animals to care for, each lost and hurt in their own way: a pair of suicidal, bra-stealing monkeys, a frustrated parrot desperate to fly, and a pig with a wicked sense of humor. The humans, too, were cause for laughter and tears. There were animal whisperers, committed staff, wildly devoted volunteers, handsome heartbreakers, and a machete-wielding prom queen who carried Laura through. Most of all, there was the jungle--lyrical and alive--and there was Wayra, who would ultimately teach Laura so much about love, healing, and the person she was capable of becoming.

Why did some live while so many others perished? Tiny children, old men, beautiful girls—in the gas chambers of Treblinka, all were equal. A central cog in the wheel of Adolf Hitler’s Final Solution, the fires of Treblinka were kept burning night and day. Chil Rajchman was twenty-eight when he arrived at Treblinka in 1942. At the extermination camp, he was forced to work as a “barber,” shaving the heads of victims, and a “dentist,” pulling gold teeth from corpses. But he escaped eleven months later and survived to tell the shocking and heartbreaking tale of his experience—and of those who didn’t make it out alive. Elie Wiesel calls The Last Jew of Treblinka “an important, heart-rending contribution to our search for truth.” Poignant and powerful, this memoir provides the only survivors’ record of the horrifying Polish extermination camp. Originally written in Yiddish in 1945, without hope or agenda other than to bear witness, Rajchman’s story shows that remembering is sometimes the bravest and most painful act of all.","ISBN_13","9781453249253","True","True","BOOK","Biography & Autobiography","4.5","9","NOT_MATURE","True","3.20.20.0.preview.3","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hWB9rK9y6iMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hWB9rK9y6iMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=hWB9rK9y6iMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:The+Last+Jew+of+Treblinka:+A+Memoir+inauthor:Chil+Rajchman&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hWB9rK9y6iMC&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hWB9rK9y6iMC","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Last_Jew_of_Treblinka-sample-epub.acsm?id=hWB9rK9y6iMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","True","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hWB9rK9y6iMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","Elie Wiesel calls The Last Jew of Treblinka “an important, heart-rending contribution to our search for truth.” Poignant and powerful, this memoir provides the only survivors’ record of the horrifying Polish extermination camp.","192","10.99","USD","10.99","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hWB9rK9y6iMC&rdid=book-hWB9rK9y6iMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","10990000","USD","10990000","USD","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Last_Jew_of_Treblinka-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hWB9rK9y6iMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api",""

Covering the period from the 1930s to the 1980s, O’Reilly and Dugard trace the prohibition-busting bank robbers of the Depression Era, such as John Dillinger, Bonnie & Clyde, Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby-Face Nelson. In addition, the authors highlight the creation of the Mafia Commission, the power struggles within the “Five Families,” the growth of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, the mob battles to control Cuba, Las Vegas and Hollywood, as well as the personal war between the U.S. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy and legendary Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa. O’Reilly and Dugard turn these legendary criminals and their true-life escapades into a read that rivals the most riveting crime novel. With Killing the Mob, their hit series is primed for its greatest success yet.","ISBN_13","9781250273666","True","False","BOOK","History","","","NOT_MATURE","True","1.1.1.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1K0HEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1K0HEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=1K0HEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Killing+the+Mob:+The+Fight+Against+Organized+Crime+in+America+(Bill+O%27Reilly%27s+Killing+Series)+inauthor:Bill+O%27Reilly&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1K0HEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1K0HEAAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/Killing_the_Mob-sample-epub.acsm?id=1K0HEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1K0HEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","In the tenth book in the multimillion-selling Killing series, Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard take on their most controversial subject yet: The Mob.","304","14.99","USD","14.99","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1K0HEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-1K0HEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","14990000","USD","14990000","USD","True","","Martin Dugard"

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is one of the most popular—and most effective—treatments for mental health conditions that result from out-of-control emotions. Combining elements of Cognitive Behavior Therapy with Eastern mindfulness practice, DBT was initially used as a powerful treatment to address the suffering associated with borderline personality disorder. It has since proven to have positive effects on many other mental health conditions and is frequently found in non-clinical settings, such as schools. Whether you struggle with depression, anger, phobias, disordered eating, or want to have a better understanding of emotions and how to focus and calm your mind, DBT practice serves the needs of those facing anything from regular life challenges to severe psychological distress. Written in a no-jargon, friendly style by two of Harvard Medical School’s finest, DBT For Dummies shows how DBT can teach new ways not just to reverse, but to actively take control of self-destructive behaviors and negative thought patterns, allowing you to transform a life of struggle into one full of promise and meaning. Used properly and persistently, the skills and strategies in this book will change your life: when you can better regulate emotions, interact effectively with people, deal with stressful situations, and use mindfulness on a daily basis, it’s easier to appreciate what’s good in yourself and the world, and then act accordingly. In reading this book, you will: Understand DBT theory Learn more adaptive ways to control your emotions Improve the quality of your relationships Deal better with uncertainty Many of life’s problems are not insurmountable even if they appear to be.

I was asked to describe my book, Yearbook, for the inside flap (which is a gross phrase) and for websites and shit like that, so… here it goes!!! Yearbook is a collection of true stories that I desperately hope are just funny at worst, and life-changingly amazing at best. (I understand that it’s likely the former, which is a fancy “book” way of saying “the first one.”) I talk about my grandparents, doing stand-up comedy as a teenager, bar mitzvahs, and Jewish summer camp, and tell way more stories about doing drugs than my mother would like. I also talk about some of my adventures in Los Angeles, and surely say things about other famous people that will create a wildly awkward conversation for me at a party one day.

Wood","Encounter Books","2020-11-10","When and where was America founded? Was it in Virginia in 1619, when a pirate ship landed a group of captive Africans at Jamestown? So asserted the New York Times in August 2019 when it announced its 1619 Project. The Times set out to transform history by tracing American institutions, culture, and prosperity to that pirate ship and the exploitation of African Americans that followed. A controversy erupted, with historians pushing back against what they say is a false narrative conjured out of racial grievance. This book sums up what the critics have said and argues that the proper starting point for the American story is 1620, with the signing of the Mayflower Compact aboard ship before the Pilgrims set foot in the Massachusetts wilderness. A nation as complex as ours, of course, has many starting points, most notably the Declaration of Independence in 1776. But the quintessential ideas of American self-government and ordered liberty grew from the deliberate actions of the Mayflower immigrants in 1620. Schools across the country have already adopted the Times’ radical revision of history as part of their curricula. The stakes are high. Should children be taught that our nation is a four-hundred-year-old system of racist oppression? Or should they learn that what has always made America exceptional is our pursuit of liberty and justice for all?","ISBN_13","9781641771252","True","True","BOOK","Education","","","NOT_MATURE","True","1.1.1.0.preview.3","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5cvnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5cvnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=5cvnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:1620:+A+Critical+Response+to+the+1619+Project+inauthor:Peter+Wood&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5cvnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5cvnDwAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/1620-sample-epub.acsm?id=5cvnDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","True","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5cvnDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","This book sums up what the critics have said and argues that the proper starting point for the American story is 1620, with the signing of the Mayflower Compact aboard ship before the Pilgrims set foot in the Massachusetts wilderness.","272","28.99","USD","15.65","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5cvnDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-5cvnDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","28990000","USD","15650000","USD","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/1620-sample-pdf.acsm?id=5cvnDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api",""

As a day trader, you can live and work anywhere in the world. You can decide when to work and when not to work. You only answer to yourself. That is the life of the successful day trader. Many people aspire to it, but very few succeed. Day trading is not gambling or an online poker game. To be successful at day trading you need the right tools and you need to be motivated, to work hard, and to persevere.At the beginning of my trading career, a pharmaceutical company announced some positive results for one of its drugs and its stock jumped from $1 to over $55 in just two days. Two days! I was a beginner at the time. I was the amateur. I purchased 1,000 shares at $4 and sold them at over $10. On my very first beginner trade, I made $6,000 in a matter of minutes.It was pure luck. I honestly had no idea what I was doing. Within a few weeks I had lost that entire $6,000 by making mistakes in other trades. I was lucky. My first stupid trade was my lucky one. Other people are not so lucky. For many, their first mistake is their last trade because in just a few minutes, in one simple trade, they lose all of the money they had worked so hard for. With their account at zero, they walk away from day trading.As a new day trader you should never lose sight of the fact that you are competing with professional traders on Wall Street and other experienced traders around the world who are very serious, highly equipped with advanced education and tools, and most importantly, committed to making money.Day trading is not gambling. It is not a hobby. You must approach day trading very, very seriously. As such, I wake up early, go for a run, take a shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, and fire up my trading station before the markets open in New York. I am awake. I am alert. I am motivated when I sit down and start working on the list of stocks I will watch that day. This morning routine has tremendously helped my mental preparation for coming into the market. Whatever your routine is, starting the morning in a similar fashion will pay invaluable dividends.Rolling out of bed and throwing water on your face 15 minutes before the opening bell just does not give you sufficient time to be prepared for the market's opening. Sitting at your computer in your pajamas or underwear does not put you in the right mindset to attack the market. I know. I've experienced all of these scenarios.In How to Day Trade for a Living, I will show you how you too can take control over your life and have success in day trading on the stock market. I love teaching. It's my passion. In this book, I use simple and easy to understand words to explain the strategies and concepts you need to know to launch yourself into day trading on the stock market. This book is definitely NOT a difficult, technical, hard to understand, complicated and complex guide to the stock market. It's concise. It's practical. It's written for everyone. You can learn how to beat Wall Street at its own game. And, as a purchaser of my book, you will also receive a membership in my community of day traders at www.vancouver-traders.com. You can monitor my screen in real time, watch me trade the strategies explained in his book, and ask questions of me and other traders in our private chat room.I invite you to join me in the world of day trading.
