Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life’s challenges—how to get relative with the inevitable—you can enjoy a state of success I call “catching greenlights.” So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Hopefully, it’s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot’s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. It’s a love letter. To life. It’s also a guide to catching more greenlights—and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too.

In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her. Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, and complete with family photos, Crying in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.","ISBN_13","9780525657750","True","False","256","BOOK","Biography & Autobiography","5","1","NOT_MATURE","True","1.1.1.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kRjzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kRjzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=kRjzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CRYING+IN+H+MART+inauthor:Michelle+Zauner&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kRjzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kRjzDwAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","True","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kRjzDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER Named a Best Book of April 2021 by • AV Club • Bustle • Entertainment Weekly • Good Morning America • Chicago Review of Books • Fortune • TIME • CNN Underscored • Apartment Therapy • ...","Knopf","13.99","USD","13.99","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kRjzDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-kRjzDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","13990000","USD","13990000","USD","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/Crying_in_H_Mart-sample-epub.acsm?id=kRjzDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api",""

They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm. Arthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury. Forty years later, Raymond’s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium—co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug’s addictiveness—was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d’Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability. The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama—baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful. Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America’s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world’s great fortunes.","ISBN_13","9780385545693","True","False","560","BOOK","Biography & Autobiography","5","1","NOT_MATURE","True","1.3.3.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:EMPIRE+OF+PAIN+inauthor:Patrick+Radden+Keefe&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","True","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap ...","Doubleday","15.99","USD","15.99","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Qb4IEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","15990000","USD","15990000","USD","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/Empire_of_Pain-sample-epub.acsm?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api",""

When Jennifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a paperback titled The Double Helix on her bed. She put it aside, thinking it was one of those detective tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Saturday, she discovered she was right, in a way. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn’t become scientists, she decided she would. Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book’s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned ​a curiosity ​of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions. The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code. Should we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing depression? Hmmm…Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids? After helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in 2020. Her story is a thrilling detective tale that involves the most profound wonders of nature, from the origins of life to the future of our species.","ISBN_13","9781982115876","True","False","560","BOOK","Biography & Autobiography","5","1","NOT_MATURE","True","2.4.4.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=intitle:THE+CODE+BREAKER+inauthor:Walter+Isaacson&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","True","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","The bestselling author of Leonardo da Vinci and Steve Jobs returns with a gripping account of how Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna and her colleagues launched a revolution that will allow us to cure diseases, fend off viruses, and have ...","Simon and Schuster","16.99","USD","16.99","USD","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-f_D3DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","16990000","USD","16990000","USD","True","http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Code_Breaker-sample-epub.acsm?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api",""

It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very lives.” —Oprah Winfrey This book is going to change the way you see your life. Have you ever wondered ""Why did I do that?"" or ""Why can't I just control my behavior?"" Others may judge our reactions and think, ""What's wrong with that person?"" When questioning our emotions, it's easy to place the blame on ourselves; holding ourselves and those around us to an impossible standard. It's time we started asking a different question. Through deeply personal conversations, Oprah Winfrey and renowned brain and trauma expert Dr. Bruce Perry offer a groundbreaking and profound shift from asking “What’s wrong with you?” to “What happened to you?” Our earliest experiences shape our lives far down the road, and What Happened to You? provides powerful scientific and emotional insights into the behavioral patterns so many of us struggle to understand. Here, Winfrey shares stories from her own past, understanding through experience the vulnerability that comes from facing trauma and adversity at a young age. Joining forces with Dr. Perry, one of the world’s leading experts on childhood and brain development, Winfrey and Dr. Perry marry the power of storytelling with science to better understand and overcome the effects of our pasts. In conversation throughout the book, the two focus on understanding people, behavior, and ourselves. It’s a subtle but profound shift in our approach to trauma, and it’s one that allows us to understand our pasts in order to clear a path to our future—opening the door to resilience and healing in a proven, powerful way.","ISBN_13","9781250223210","True","False","256","BOOK","Psychology","","","NOT_MATURE","True","1.2.2.0.preview.2","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:WHAT+HAPPENED+TO+YOU%3F+inauthor:Bruce+D.+Perry+and+Oprah+Winfrey&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ","US","FOR_SALE","True","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_BreDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very lives.”—Oprah Winfrey This book is going to change the way you see your life.

From Standard Oil, and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, to the Progressive Era's trust-busters, Amy Klobuchar, in this large, compelling history, writes of the fight against monopolies in America. She writes of the breakup of Ma Bell, the pricing monopoly of Big Pharma, and the future of the giant tech companies (Facebook, Amazon, Google). She begins with the Gilded Age (1870s-1900), when builders of fortunes and rapacious robber barons such as J. P. Morgan, John Rockefeller, and Cornelius Vanderbilt were reaping vast fortunes as industrialization swept across the American landscape, with the rich getting vastly richer and the poor, poorer. She discusses President Theodore Roosevelt, who, during the Progressive Era (1890s-1920), busted the trusts (breaking up monopolies); the Clayton Act of 1914; the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914; and the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950 (it strengthened the Clayton Act). She explores today's Big Pharma and its price-gouging; and tech, television, content, and agriculture communities and how a marketplace with few players, or one in which one company dominates distribution, can hurt consumer prices and stifle innovation. As the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, Klobuchar is at work on, among others, issues raised by giant tech companies, such as Facebook, Google (it reportedly controls 90 percent of the search engine market), and Amazon, and puts forth her plans, ideas, and legislative proposals designed to strengthen the antitrust laws and antitrust enforcement.","ISBN_13","9780525654896","False","False","624","BOOK","Business & Economics","","","NOT_MATURE","False","preview-1.0.0","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SH0rEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SH0rEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=SH0rEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ANTITRUST+inauthor:Amy+Klobuchar&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=SH0rEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:ANTITRUST+inauthor:Amy+Klobuchar&hl=&source=gbs_api","https://books.google.com/books/about/Antitrust.html?hl=&id=SH0rEAAAQBAJ","US","NOT_FOR_SALE","False","US","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","False","False","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=SH0rEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","As the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, Klobuchar is at work on, among others, issues raised by giant tech companies, such as Facebook, Google (it reportedly controls ...","Knopf","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
