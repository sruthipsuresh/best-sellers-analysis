Koonin,“surging sea levels are inundating the coasts” “hurricanes and tornadoes are becoming fiercer and more frequent” “climate change will be an economic disaster” you’ve heard all this presented as fact but according to science all of these statements are profoundly misleading when it comes to climate change the media politicians and other prominent voices have declared that “the science is settled” in reality the long game of telephone from research to reports to the popular media is corrupted by misunderstanding and misinformation core questions—about the way the climate is responding to our influence and what the impacts will be—remain largely unanswered the climate is changing but the why and how aren’t as clear as you’ve probably been led to believe now one of america’s most distinguished scientists is clearing away the fog to explain what science really says (and doesn’t say) about our changing climate in unsettled: what climate science tells us what it doesn't and why it matters steven koonin draws upon his decades of experience—including as a top science advisor to the obama administration—to provide up-to-date insights and expert perspective free from political agendas fascinating clear-headed and full of surprises this book gives readers the tools to both understand the climate issue and be savvier consumers of science media in general koonin takes readers behind the headlines to the more nuanced science itself showing us where it comes from and guiding us through the implications of the evidence he dispels popular myths and unveils little-known truths: despite a dramatic rise in greenhouse gas emissions global temperatures actually decreased from 1940 to 1970 what’s more the models we use to predict the future aren’t able to accurately describe the climate of the past suggesting they are deeply flawed koonin also tackles society’s response to a changing climate using data-driven analysis to explain why many proposed “solutions” would be ineffective and discussing how alternatives like adaptation and if necessary geoengineering will ensure humanity continues to prosper unsettled is a reality check buoyed by hope offering the truth about climate science that you aren’t getting elsewhere—what we know what we don’t and what it all means for our future,unsettled what climate science tells us what it doesn’t and why it matters,4,1

27,52,1620,A Critical Response to the 1619 Project,Peter W. Wood,when and where was america founded was it in virginia in 1619 when a pirate ship landed a group of captive africans at jamestown so asserted the new york times in august 2019 when it announced its 1619 project the times set out to transform history by tracing american institutions culture and prosperity to that pirate ship and the exploitation of african americans that followed a controversy erupted with historians pushing back against what they say is a false narrative conjured out of racial grievance this book sums up what the critics have said and argues that the proper starting point for the american story is 1620 with the signing of the mayflower compact aboard ship before the pilgrims set foot in the massachusetts wilderness a nation as complex as ours of course has many starting points most notably the declaration of independence in 1776 but the quintessential ideas of american self-government and ordered liberty grew from the deliberate actions of the mayflower immigrants in 1620 schools across the country have already adopted the times’ radical revision of history as part of their curricula the stakes are high should children be taught that our nation is a four-hundred-year-old system of racist oppression or should they learn that what has always made america exceptional is our pursuit of liberty and justice for all,1620 a critical response to the 1619 project,0,6
